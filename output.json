In addition, funding is provided to support treatment interventions for criminal risk factors such as antisocial thoughts and attitudes, antisocial peers, impulsivity and poor problem solving skills, anger management and so on. Effective interventions for adults should integrate addictions treatment with treatment for criminality.

		"Program Summary": "The Treatment First Program is a collaborative effort between DCJ, the courts, the DA's office, the public defender's office, local law enforcement, and community treatment providers. The program involves the use of a validated risk and needs assessment tool and serves a mixed population of low risk/need and moderate to high risk/need individuals. The program provides quadrant levels and separate group treatment services to ensure low risk individuals are not attending group sessions with moderate and high risk individuals and that their specific needs are met. Defendants with low risk and low needs will be assigned to a low supervision track. The Treatment First model reserves the STOP Court for the highest need, highest risk individuals while creating alternative tracks that match program design to individuals' needs and profiles. By creating multiple treatment tracks besides the STOP Court, the county is able to provide an appropriate system response to individuals who are non-addicted and/or low-risk. DCJ's contribution to the Treatment First program is the Assessment Team, which consists of  3 Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) who assess all incoming Treatment First drug cases using evidence-based risk assessment tools. These assessments are used to place incoming justice involved individuals (JIIs) in the level of supervision that research shows to be the most effective for their level of risk and specific A&D need. The assessment team assess JIIs both in and out of custody, and works closely with the Court, DA's Office and Defense Bar during the early Court process. Those placed in the STOP Court are supervised by a total of 3 PPOs. STOP serves adults charged with various drug-related offenses. Multnomah County's Drug Court is one of the oldest of its kind that collaborates with criminal justice partners to expedite the court process and offer drug treatment and is one component of the Treatment First Program. The treatment component is facilitated by a contracted agency who works closely with the court to provide mental health and drug treatment, employment resources, housing referrals, mentoring, residential treatment referrals and long-term follow-up services. The STOP Court is also staffed by PPOs who support the court by offering supervision, sanction and services.

Placing high risk, high need offenders directly into housing with services upon release are consistent with the current Multnomah County plan to end homelessness by circumventing individuals entry into homelessness and cycling in and out of incarceration.With the scarcity of housing for justice-involved individuals it is important to maintain all housing options while research is done to identify more affordable options. This offer would restore the numbers of beds at the Shoreline to 62.As renovation work begins at the East County campus and with staff eventually being moved permanently into the North and West buildings on that campus, more justice-involved individuals will be supervised out of this office. A goal will be to continue to work with providers to increase housing options in East County, which would likely be more affordable as well as closer to where justice-involved individuals are living and receiving services.DCJ will continue to increase partnerships with other County departments, such as the Joint Office of Homeless Services and Mental Health and Addiction Services, and housing providers to identify housing in this area. The goal will be to identify more affordable housing than the current options of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) in downtown Portland. This past year additional beds were provided in East County by the opening of the Diane Wade House. In addition, the Joint Office of Homeless Services opened a temporary shelter in the South Building of the East Campus and is working to open a permanent shelter in the area. ",

		"Program Summary": "Defendants facing a prison term who meet the eligibility requirements are identified by the District Attorney. The Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP) includes funding for the jail to expedite assessments, for the court and the defense to assist with case coordination and scheduling, a deputy district attorney to facilitate case identification and case management, law enforcement to assist DCJ in monitoring individuals before and after sentencing, and additional staff at DCJ to carry out the program (assessment, report writing, and supervision). Also, 10% of the funding for Multnomah County must be appropriated to a non-profit working with crime victims. DCJ conducts an objective assessment of criminal risk and makes recommendations for how the individual could be managed in the community. This report is provided to the defense, prosecution, and court prior to sentencing and informs the sentencing process. For those individuals who are sentenced to probation rather than prison, DCJ provides intensive supervision, along with referrals to treatment. The case plan is individualized based on the person's specific criminal risk factors and community stability needs. This program offer also supports the ongoing Reentry Enhancement Coordination program. This is an evidence-based addictions treatment program for people leaving prison, and includes treatment, housing, mentoring, and employment assistance. In 2017, MCJRP secured a supplemental grant through CJC which addresses special populations (women and young justice involved individuals - JIIs) and second sentence programs. This additional funding provided a .5 victims advocate to the prosecution, a district attorney to review all probation violations to inform revocations, and two positions with the Defense to support JIIs accessing services and programs pre-adjudication. The MCJRP Law Enforcement (LE) Team comprised of two officers is also funded through this supplemental grant. To affect women, there are two Community Health Specialists who are trained in providing gender-informed services, trauma informed care and are skilled at helping the JJI navigate the health and mental health systems, as well as other resources in the community. They work in tandem with the gender responsive Parole-Probation Officer.",

DCJ utilizes the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI), the Womens Risk Need Assessment (WRNA) and Public Safety Checklist (PSC) assessment tools to measure the risks and needs of adult. The LS/CMI is also a fully functioning case management tool. The LS/CMI provides a summary of the individuals static and dynamic criminogenic risk and need factors, as well as special responsivity considerations to be deployed during supervision. The WRNA is a gender-responsive risk assessment created with justice involved womens social and psychological needs in mind. The PSC provides a quick, objective, validated assessment of the probability an individual will be re-convicted of a felony or re-arrested for a person or property offense based on specific characteristics. DCJ continues to use Effective Practices in Corrections Setting (EPICS), an evidence-based case management model. With EPICS, Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) follow a structured approach to their interactions with their clients, allowing PPOs to effectively target the criminogenic needs using cognitive behavioral interventions for high risk individuals. PPOs reinforce law-abiding behavior and link clients to treatment, employment and other services. Supervision is conducted through: a) home and office visits; b) contacts with family; c) correspondence with community members and treatment providers; and d) collaboration with law enforcement agencies. Adult supervision is an essential component of public safety. Nearly all prison inmates return to their county of sentencing upon release, where they must complete post-prison supervision. The risk of these individuals committing new crimes is reduced when evidence-based supervision is in place and monitored. Implementing effective supervision practices has contributed to lower recidivism rates as compared to the Statewide average.",

Polygraph examinations are required for monitoring compliance with treatment expectations and supervision conditions.This program has a direct impact on community safety and maintains high standards for accountability.

Sexual and general recidivism rates of treated individuals convicted of sexual offenses has also been shown to be lower than recidivism rates of untreated individuals convicted of sex offenses (Looman et al 2000; Hanson et al 2002). The use of polygraph examinations is invaluable in the management and treatment of individuals convicted of sex offenses due to the information gained through the examination process. Furthermore, the use of polygraph examinations is also associated with a decline in recidivism rates (Cole, 2006; Edson et al., 2007; English et al., 2000; Krueger, 2009).",

As such, a reduction of 1.00 FTE for this work unit is a 12.5% reduction in the workforce but equates to a 25% reduction in service capacity. This reduction will limit resources to meet the needs of the community. Specific impacts may include the following: 1)  Response times may be longer than desired due to limited number of officers available to respond, resulting in delayed response to public safety issues such as loose aggressive dogs, animals in distress, dog bite investigations, animals in traffic, cruelty investigations and welfare checks; 2) Officers' ability to respond to and assist law enforcement agencies in a timely manner may be reduced; 3) Officers' workloads may increase, especially during the peak season, resulting in greater use of overtime; and 4) The program will have greater difficulty meeting daily demands when officers are on vacation/sick, leaving the team even more shorthanded in the field.",

Additionally, these factors considered equity by including demographics and access to services in prioritizing projects in communities that have been historically underserved. Multnomah County developed the scoring criteria to analyze the accessibility and usability of curb ramps on the countys road network for persons who use mobility devices such as wheelchairs and crutches.This project will start project development of the tier one priority ramps, moving them closer to construction.",

		"Program Summary": "Unincorporated Multnomah County is a unique and highly sought after location to live, work and recreate because it offers open spaces, natural and scenic resources, forests and farmland in close proximity to the state's largest city. Land Use Planning develops and implements codes and policies to preserve the rural character by preventing urban sprawl.The focus of the Long-Range Planning program is to create, revise and adopt plans, policies, and zoning codes in a uniform, fair and equitable manner to ensure that development is consistent with the rural character of the county. At the end of 2016, the county adopted the revised Comprehensive Plan and staff are currently consolidating the Zoning Code. Long-Range Planning staff will continue to focus on drafting code to implement the community's vision articulated within the revised plan. Planning staff also play a key role in coordinating with regional partners, such as Metro and the Columbia River Gorge Commission, to ensure the countys vision and values continue to be achieved. Further, planning staff help the county achieve goals for rural areas by addressing policies and plans within the Urban Growth Boundary.The Current Planning program provides assistance to property owners, neighbors, developers, realtors and other agencies with the land use process to objectively, consistently and fairly apply the countys development standards and procedures. Staff explain land use rules, review land use and building applications for compliance with applicable laws and problem solves complex land use issues with applicants and community members. The Code Compliance program responds to possible land use complaints on a voluntary compliance basis. The focus of this program is education and compliance to successfully resolve existing and potential issues. This is accomplished by encouraging property owners to voluntarily resolve land use conflicts without the use of penalties or fines whenever possible. Planning also manages a Solid Waste and Recycling Management program, which provides outreach materials and licenses service providers in the unincorporated areas of the county for solid waste and recyclable materials.

		"Program Summary": "Facilities and Property Management (FPM) is continuously evaluating energy and utility consumption across the County in order to identify anomalies, maximize saving energy opportunities and minimize the County's utility expenses. Utility expenses are a pass through charge to the building tenants that either occupy owned or leased space in facilities used for County operations.  Electric utilities constitute about half of the utility expenses followed by water/sewer, natural gas and waste/refuse. Facilities continues to work with the Office of Sustainability to educate building occupants on the value of resource conservation. The Energy-Utility Specialist in the Director's Office works with industry partners including the Energy Trust of Oregon, Oregon Department of Energy and the City of Portland to address operating efficiency and capture incentives for energy savings measures.  Utility rates fluctuate from year to year based on the availability of energy sources. These rates increase similar to the cost of inflation over time, but can vary based on economic factors. FPM implements energy and water efficiency projects in collaboration with building occupants to reduce consumption and achieve Climate Action Plan goals. In FY 2018, the Board of County Commissioners resolved to purchase 100% of electricity through renewable energy sources, consequently the FY 2020 utility rates continues to include the cost of purchasing renewable energy credits.",

The Healthy Streets pilot project is one component of a strategy to reduce the number of improperly discarded syringes and provide the public a safe community-based disposal option.Sharps disposal boxes create a 24/7 disposal option for safe disposal of syringes by community members finding used syringes. In partnership with other jurisdictions, the County has developed a website and communication materials to support the public in taking action when finding syringes. After reviewing existing designs for syringe drop boxes, the Healthy Streets pilot partners agreed to design and fabricate a unique, more tamper resistant syringe box. The procurement, design and fabrication of these boxes took longer than expect, and the boxes were installed in April 2019.

This lays the groundwork for required implementation by key applications and populations in the successive phases.  Network Access Control: With the increase of network activity on our industrial network (doors, security, heating and cooling, etc) we are at greater risk of experiencing a breach in that environment due to the fact that the environment is largely not understood or defined.  Network Access Control  can help us to understand what should and should not be on our network and restrict what these devices are able to access based on rules that we define.Privileged Access and Identity Management: Privileged access is the access most often targeted by cyber security threats because this access leads to the most valuable and confidential information.  Implementing a Privileged Access and Identity Management solution will allow us to have better control in managing and securing privileged accounts to meet the needs of the access control requirement for a number of the compliance regulations.

Designing a leadership development and accountability model was a key recommendation outlined in the JRG recommendation, reinforced by the COO as a top priority, and again echoed as a critical next step in the county-wide surveys the Office of Diversity and Equity conducted in January '19. The design of a Leadership Development and Accountability model will focus on current managers as well as newly hired managers. The Leadership Development and Accountability Program is for current and newly hired managers, will ensure managers and supervisors leverage their authority to promote safety, trust, and belonging, and lead with a racial justice focus.

Tangible evidence must be reproduced by the district attorneys office and provided to the defense attorney. When body-worn camera evidence is received by the DAs Office, the process of reviewing and replicating the evidence will be mandatory, not discretionary.

		"Program Summary": "Primary among the duties of a deputy district attorney is to review cases submitted by local law enforcement agencies to determine whether the case should be charged as a crime.  This function is at the heart of the prosecution function.  The charging decision in every case is guided by a 22-step analysis contained within the MCDA Policy Manual.  As the case progresses through the system, the video may need to be re-reviewed, redacted, reformatted, and used in trial preparation and witness preparation.Police departments across the United States are phasing in the use of body warn cameras.  The Gresham Police Department has instituted an aggressive timeline for equipping their officers with body-worn cameras. Conservative estimates state that 1.5 hours of video will be created by a police officer on every shift.  Of this 1.5 hours, 10% will contain video pertinent to a criminal case  video that must be reviewed prior to charging and must be reproduced and given to the defense after charging.Body-worn camera evidence will be reviewed by a deputy district attorney.  Duplication and distribution of body-worn camera evidence will be accomplished by non-lawyer staff.  A review of comparably-sized offices from around the country has shown that, with the adoption of body-warn cameras by law enforcement, prosecutors personnel costs rose between 3%  10%.  For example, the Wayne County District Attorneys Office (Detroit, MI) experienced an 8% increase in personnel costs after several of their law enforcement partners began using body-worn cameras.Data from body-worn cameras will be voluminous and secure storage will be necessary to comply with witness/victim privacy concerns as well as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) compliance requirements.Body-worn camera footage will allow prosecutors to view crime scenes and witness/victim/suspect interviews through an unfiltered lens.  Transparency and system confidence will increase by virtue of additional objective evidence available for subsequent review.  Charging decisions will improve, leading to better, more just, outcomes.For additional MCDA Budget Information: http://mcda.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MCDA-Budget-Informational-Packet-FY-20.pdf",

This further insight will facilitate informed policy decision making to strategically address disparities within our county.Furthermore, the trend in public safety in the county and across the nation is for increased cooperation among peers to answer questions greater than any one entity.  Experience here in the county has shown that when one partner in criminal justice evaluation comes to the table without the capacity to keep up with others, that weak link causes the whole enterprise to suffer.  As public safety systems in Multnomah County join to tackle important questions, the District Attorneys office is determined to be an equal partner with others in this endeavor.  That commitment requires an expansion of the offices evaluation capacity to invest resources in maintaining and developing new partnerships and programs.Internally, the DAs office is asking more sophisticated questions about its own workings, including examinations of equity and disparity in prosecution, DDA workload and effectiveness, and case flow efficiency.  At one time it may have been sufficient to find answers to these questions through the authority of long tenure, management discussion and speculation by line staff.  These older methods are insufficient in the face of greater reliance in the county and nationwide on sophisticated data analyses that provide more objective means to drive policy.  The offices single temporary evaluator can no longer meet our needs; we must be about the business of building a more robust research and planning enterprise.http://mcda.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MCDA-Budget-Informational-Packet-FY-20.pdf",

This Unit prosecutes juveniles who have committed all but the most serious (Ballot Measure 11) crimes. This includes cases ranging from minor misdemeanors to serious felonies. The unit works closely with the Department of Community Justice (DCJ) Juvenile Division in developing appropriate sanctions aimed at accountability, community protection and reformation of the child or youth.  Additionally, one of the goals of this program is to reduce the number of youth who are exposed to the adult criminal system.For over 25 years this program has been involved in the Anne E. Casey Foundations Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI). The current interagency agreement with the Juvenile Services Division provides for opportunities for youth to have their matters handled informally, either through the CHI Early Intervention Program, or through informal handling by the Juvenile Department.  The current agreement calls for MCDA to provide legal sufficiency screening of all referrals, to insure that youth are held accountable only for acts that are legally sufficient.  Legal sufficiency screening by non-lawyers often results in youth being held accountable inappropriately.  The goal of these programs is to provide the principles of accountable and reformation without pulling a youth further into the Juvenile System.  These DDAs coordinate with the Department of Human Services, DCJ and juvenile court counselors to serve families impacted by the juvenile system.  Beginning July 1, 2019, the Department of Human Services will redirect state and federal funds from MCDA to pay their own lawyers at the Department of Justice to represent DHS in all TPR and dependency matters in Multnomah County. Refer to Program 15101B (Dependency and Delinquency) which partially restores this unit to two primary functions to serve families in Multnomah County.

		"Executive Summary": "MCSO will support Corrections Health by increasing its Clinic Escort Deputy Staff by one thus creating a swing shift clinic at MCIJ and MCDC.  This will significantly increase inmate access to mental health clinicians, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.  Moreover, the length of appointments and quality of care will be enhanced by extending hours of clinician availability. This increase of 1.82 FTE for Corrections Deputy staffing will have significant positive outcomes for both MCSO and Corrections Health.",
		"Department": "Sheriff",
		"Related Programs": "",
		"Program Summary": "Corrections Health currently operates clinics within MCDC and MCIJ. Currently, clinics are operated during the day shift, Monday through Friday. This schedule often does not allow for the ease of movement of inmates seeking medical or mental health appointments due to staffing short falls. Other aspects of jail operations which require the presence of an Escort Deputy such as court appearance movements, off-site for work crew projects, kitchen work crews, attorney visits, social services visits and other necessary tasks often limits staffing.  These multiple demands on Escorts at times limit the ability to move inmates for medical/mental health appointments due to the lack of Escort Deputy availability.MCSO has assessed, through collaboration with Corrections Health, the need for increased access to medical/mental health appointments. As such, the dedication of one additional Clinic Escort Deputy for expanded hours on swing shift at MCDC and MCIJ will allow medical/mental health appointments to be made much more frequently thus significantly increasing access for inmates to these critical services. A further expected positive outcome of this improvement is the shortening of jail stays, lessening of the use of force events, increased therapeutic assessments, fewer injuries to inmates and staff, potential release from custody, and an increased placement of inmates in the appropriate venues such as LEAD, Unity Center, Hospital, etc.  The upstaffing of the Clinic Escort Deputy position allows for the safe and secure management of the inmate population requiring Clinic services and creates a safe and secure working environment for Corrections Health Staff. The expansion of the presence of the Clinic Escort Deputy will significantly enhance an inmates ability to attend medical/mental health appointments and will increase access for clinicians to better serve the inmate population.",

Most of these services are performed for agencies and non-profits that serve the homeless and other at-risk groups within the community. Crews have participated in community events such as Friends of the Library, Sand in the City, March of Dimes March for Babies, Polar Plunge, and Race for the Cure to name a few. Work Crews help in the set up and removal of tents, chairs and activity areas used during these events. The donated time and labor of work crews supply an invaluable resource to ensure these events are successful. In addition, work crews offer an emergency labor force during natural or man-made disasters (i.e., sandbagging, removal of downed trees).The majority of contracts are with Multnomah County, Oregon Department of Transportation, City of Portland and Metro Regional Government. Other agencies include the cities of Gresham, Troutdale, Fairview and Wood Village. Public contracted work normally consists of roadside, bridgehead and park maintenance, landscaping and a concentrated effort on cleaning up illegal dumpsites.",

Important factors when determining appropriate housing for an adult in custody include; criminal charge, institutional behavior, risk, and programmatic needs. The Units primary goal is to operate an objective classification system that provides for separations between violent and non-violent offenders and to facilitate movement through administrative processes from the most restrictive housing to the least restrictive housing in a safe and structured manner. This is a critical element to ensure that the jail meets a reasonable standard of care required by the United States Constitution. Best practice has shown that utilizing an objective classification process is key. This process creates a structure that allows in custody adults who require special housing or have special needs to be housed in an environment with those of like needs. Adults in custody who create the potential for compromising safety and security are housed in more restrictive environments with enhanced security as appropriate. The objective classification process is also designed to identify programmatic needs and provide adequate services and programs to assist in custody adults in building positive life-skills with the ultimate goal of successful re-entry into the community. Finally, the Classification Unit is also responsible to provide an in custody disciplinary process that is fair and balanced to maintain proper order in the corrections facilities, as well as to promote human values, individual dignity, and socially desirable changes in attitude and behavior. Holding adults in custody accountable while under the supervision of the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office is critical to maintain a safe work environment for both employees and adults in custody.",

Working with schools, businesses, and neighborhood associations, deputies seek to understand community needs and using problem solving skills to assess, investigate, and intervene in criminal activities. The Corbett and Reynolds School Resource Officers work with at-risk children and their families and provide educational classes addressing various issues including drug use. Deputies provide the first necessary step toward intervention. They are not only a stabilizing force for youth, but in many cases act as role models toward the juveniles they encounter daily. SRO activities include: illegal drug enforcement, prevention and education; providing resources for guiding and intervening with at risk high school students by supporting their teachers and parents; and intervening in the exploitation, molestation and physical abuse of children and assisting their families. A visible public safety system is a critical factor to citizens feeling safe at home, school, work, and play. Evidence through the Bureau of Justice Administration studies shows that community policing is a proven and historical strategy to community safety.",

		"Program Summary": "MCSO participates in the interagency East Metro Gang Enforcement Team (EMGET). No individual law enforcement agency can adequately respond to this unique threat to life, property, and quality of life that has no jurisdictional bounds. As a result, East County law enforcement agencies have banded together to seek grants; improve interagency and interdisciplinary communications; coordinate field efforts, records, and information databases; empower residents and businesses to present a united front to counter gang activity; work in close cooperation with social services to address the issues that led persons into gangs and in preventative measures for those at risk for joining gangs; and collectively working with specifically assigned members of the District Attorneys Office to prosecute the gang involved criminal conduct. All these collective efforts are to identify gang members; reduce actual and feared gang related criminal activity; empower the community to unite against gang activities and influence; and provide enhanced and focused law enforcement efforts to reduce actual and feared gang related criminal activity.In areas east of 162nd Avenue, the EMGET provides focused investigative assets towards gang related violent and other high impact neighborhood crimes; conducts proactive measures to prevent gang related crimes and activities; provides expertise to regular field staff and the community in gang issues; and collaborates with other criminal justice partners, social services, and neighborhoods to identify gang related issues and solve gang related problems.

		"Department": "Sheriff",

		"Program Summary": "Annually, the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office Search and Rescue Unit (SAR) experiences a high volume call workload from May through September in the late afternoon and early evening hours. Typically, a tourist hiker that has gone for a day hike at one of the many trailheads in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and, due to reduced daylight, has become disoriented which may result in injury or death. The MCSO \"Green Hornet Trail Rescue and wilderness Law Enforcement Team\" mission will be to decrease the Search and Rescue response times to missing and endangered persons calls at or near Columbia River Gorge trail locations.MCSO currently has members who are physically fit endurance athletes who are experienced with hiking, trail running, map reading, etc. By providing SAR training and necessary equipment, this program will significantly decrease SAR response call times and increase the opportunity to locate the lost and possibly injured persons much faster resulting in reduced overtime expense to MCSO (SAR related overtime averages approximately $100,000 per year). Twelve team members can provide preventative and proactive law enforcement/education functions during trailhead heavy use days, further reducing search incidents and impacting high incidents of property crime at these locations.In FY 2015, the Green Hornet Trail Rescue and Wilderness Law Enforcement Services Team utilized budgeted funds to train and equip members under newly established Oregon State Sheriff's Association search and rescue standards. This training added new capabilities which allow the team to be more effective in evening and night hours better meeting the needs of the hikers who find themselves lost and requiring rescue services. In the past, many searches had to wait for the next day break, this changes the outcome in favor of the lost hikers by the rescue team being less restricted by night conditions.  Additionally, this program will develop strategies to actively engage in proactive education and enforcement activities response to search, rescue and public safety issues developed from the Eagle Creek Fire.As hazardous conditions created by the fire continue to improve, it is anticipated that federal lands will incrementally re-open in FY19, providing for an increase in search and rescue incidents.",

This combination of early assessment and intervention is provided to reduce recidivism while protecting public safety. Success is only possible through the partnership of the participating MCJRP members.In cooperation with parole and probation officers, enforcement officers serve arrest warrants and detainers, assist with home visits, address verifications checks, transports to housing/appointments, welfare checks, assist with criminal investigations, and pro-actively patrol areas in which offenders reside or commit crimes. This program offer funds 1.00 FTE Enforcement Deputy to work in conjunction with a City of Portland Police Officer in the community supporting the Justice Reinvestment program.Effective intervention to increase the likelihood of success for MCJRP eligible individuals and protect public safety requires swift/certain sanctions, home visits, and enforcement of court orders and warrants. This makes individuals accountable to program and supervision requirements while they are in the community.Originally, the Law Enforcement Detail was comprised of more than 60 Law Enforcement Officers and Sheriffs Deputies from all partner agencies have volunteered for overtime shifts to participate in the detail. The detail appears to be successful in providing the identified benefits. However, it is agreed that rotating officers and deputies is not optimal because it limits consistent contact and practices to most effectively support the partnership with PPOs. The Law Enforcement Detail is now two full time spots filled by one MCSO Deputy and one PPB Officer. The full time spots have shown to be the most successful and effective method for creating meaningful relationships with PPOs and MCJRP offenders.",

Illegal dumping is a crime. Illegal dumping is a major problem that raises significant concerns with regard to safety, property values, and quality of life in the community. In addition, it is a major economic burden on local government, which is typically responsible for cleaning up dump sites. If not addressed, illegal dumps often attract more waste, potentially including hazardous wastes such as asbestos, household chemicals, paints, automotive fluids, and commercial or industrial wastes. Health risks associated with illegal dumping are significant. The regional housing crisis is resulting in more people living outside. The detectives coordinate with Metro staff, local police departments including MCSO Hope Team and social service providers to ensure impacts to Metros 17,000 acres of natural areas and parks are safely and humanely addressed. The need for this coordination increased significantly over the past two to three years which reduces the available time the detectives have to conduct investigations and surveillance. The Deputies skills and knowledge are a valuable asset to Metro as is the MCSO HOPE team. ",
