17	The Director's Office provides the Department of Community Justice (DCJ) with policy, program and fiscal direction to 
18	achieve its mission of enhancing community safety and reducing criminal activity. DCJ is a 24-hour operation with over 500 
19	regular employees. The Directors Office coordinates volunteers provided throughout DCJ. This office also provides 
20	leadership, communication, fiscal management, and coordination across the Departments Divisions. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	The Directors Office monitors the daily operations of an agency that promotes community safety through supervision and 
24	treatment resources to youth, adults, and families to address the underlying issues and problems that drive crime. It is the 
25	role of the Directors Office to hold the Department accountable to county residents, the Board of County Commissioners 
26	and system partners. From intake and assessment through discharge, the youth, adults, and families we serve receive a 
27	continuum of services to help them reintegrate into their communities and promote community safety.
28	
29	In FY 2019, DCJ supervised over 12,000 probationers and post-prison justice involved adults in the community who have 
30	been convicted of felony and misdemeanor crimes. Our Juvenile Services Division provides community supervision for high-
31	risk youth, and operates the Donald E. Long Juvenile Detention Facility, a regional facility that houses up to 64 youth daily. 
32	Our Family Court Services program provides services for at-risk families as they go through separation and divorce. The 
33	Crime Victim Services Unit is responsible for advancing DCJ's long-term commitment to crime victims' rights and needs.
34	
35	The Director's office oversees administrative functions that support our direct service work. Business Services provides 
36	fiscal management of our county, state, federal and private grant funds. The Research and Planning (RAP) team promotes 
37	the use of evidence-based practices and data-informed decision-making at all levels of the department. The Business 
38	Applications and Technology (BAT) team directs the evaluation, selection, purchase, implementation and training of 
39	effective, innovative technology solutions to enhance DCJs effectiveness. Human Resources supports our employees, 
40	including the needs of management and members of three different unions.

18	The Department of Community Justice (DCJ) Business Services provides administrative and business services to the 
19	Department through exercising sound, accurate and transparent financial management.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	DCJ is funded by a variety of federal, state, local and other grant sources. A primary responsibility of Business Services is to 
24	integrate these resources to develop a balanced budget that meets Oregon Budget Law, County policies, and the 
25	accounting practices established by the Countys Chief Financial Officer. Business Services ensures that the Department's

18	The Business Applications and Technology (BAT) unit supports the implementation and use of information systems and data 
19	reporting tools to increase the effectiveness of staff and improve the delivery of services to internal customers, Criminal 
20	Justice Partners, and the individuals we serve. BAT also manages the Court Appearance Notification System (CANS), and 
21	Case Companion, a multi-jurisdictional online resource that provides vital, easily accessible information for victims of crime 
22	in Multnomah County.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The BAT unit provides oversight for evaluation, selection, purchase and implementation of effective, innovative technology 
27	solutions. BAT collaborates with partner agencies from local, state and federal governments as well as private service 
28	providers in order to develop system-wide technology solutions for data sharing. Team members of BAT work to foster the 
29	use and understanding of data management and reports for decision-making and facilitate a variety of information system 
30	trainings that enhance the Department of Community Justices (DCJ) operations.
31	
32	CANS works by reminding defendants of upcoming court hearing dates, times and locations which help to reduce failure to 
33	appear (FTAs) and costs to the various enforcement agencies. The automated telephone reminder and alert system also 
34	notifies adults on supervision of payments due on restitution, compensatory and/or supervision fees, and appointments with 
35	their Parole-Probation Officers (PPO). CANS regularly monitors and reports program performance to the Local Public 
36	Safety Coordination Council (LPSCC) and the Criminal Justice Advisory Committee (CJAC).
37	
38	This program offer contains services provided by the County's Information Technology organization which facilitate support 
39	for information needs of the Department, system partners and the public. This includes development and maintenance, 
40	training and on-going support of information systems to support business needs and easy access to data in order for DCJ to 
41	effectively utilize technology. This program offer also provides for the purchase and replacement of computer equipment, 
42	software and technology tools. This program offer also includes funding for the continuation and expansion of Case 
43	Companion Victims Portal, an online resource that provides important and easily accessible information for victims of 
44	crime. 
45	
46	Through innovative technological solutions and wise technology investments, the Department is better equipped to promote 
47	community safety and reduce criminal activity. This unit demonstrates effective agency collaboration and fiscal 
48	responsibility.

18	Community supervision serves three main purposes: 1) holding justice involved youth and adults accountable, 2) provide 
19	tools for making positive changes in individuals' behavior, and 3) protecting the rights of victims/survivors and the larger 
20	community. The Crime Victim Services Unit ensures that the department is fulfilling its legal obligation to uphold crime 
21	victims rights and ensures best practices by coordinating and enhancing each divisions response to the crime victims 
22	rights to individual crime victims/survivors of justice involved adults and youth on supervision.  
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The Crime Victim Services Unit is responsible for advancing the goals of the Department of Community Justice (DCJ) 
27	Strategic Plan related to our long-term commitment to crime victims rights and needs. The Crime Victim Services Unit is 
28	responsible for problem-solving to improve responsivity to crime victims both within DCJ and across our public safety 
29	partners.
30	
31	This unit collaborates with public safety agencies and community partners as well as DCJ staff to develop a more 
32	coordinated system response to crime victim issues. The unit is charged with making sure DCJ is acting in compliance with 
33	the rights of crime victims in accordance with Oregon statutes, reaching out to crime victims and providing information about 
34	individuals on supervision and the corrections system if desired, improving the collection of restitution, and providing 
35	emergency assistance to crime victims. The unit also provides training to DCJ staff on crime victims rights, restitution 
36	collection, and becoming more responsive to crime victims. A crime victims portal has been developed to increase and 
37	simplify victim access to the criminal justice system. Lastly, this unit includes a position devoted specifically to staffing the 
38	County's Sex Trafficking Collaborative, a partnership of more than 300 individuals and 15 agencies coordinating a 
39	community response to trafficking and supporting survivors.

18	The purpose of the Research & Planning (RAP) Unit is to collect, interpret, analyze, and disseminate information regarding 
19	the characteristics, activities, operations, and policies of the Department of Community Justice. This information is used by 
20	many stakeholders for operational decision-making, policy formulation, mandatory reporting, quality assurance and 
21	improvement, and release to the general public.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The RAP Unit supports the data and analysis needs of the three department divisions. These analyses promote effective 
26	resource management and the attainment of the departments strategic goals. The unit is responsible for designing and 
27	implementing a system of interactive data monitoring dashboards as part of the Countys Tableau Software initiative. The 
28	unit also produces more complex data analyses involving multivariate models and longitudinal time trend analyses.  
29	
30	In addition to quantitative analyses, RAP develops qualitative research protocols facilitated primarily by key informant 
31	interviews and focus groups. This is an important practice for soliciting scientifically valid feedback from staff and justice 
32	involved individuals regarding DCJ practices and needed quality improvements. The unit promotes the adoption of 
33	evidence-based practices through continual identification and dissemination of emerging best practices in the literature. The 
34	unit helps to ensure that departmental operations have fidelity and are delivered in a manner optimizing positive outcomes. 
35	RAP also develops new grant applications for service enhancements and research projects. When DCJ receives federal or 
36	state grants or contracts containing an evaluation component, RAP is responsible for the coordination and development of 
37	mandatory reports and other deliverables to funders. 
38	
39	The unit is a contracted data and evaluation resource for local jurisdictions without their own research team. Within the 
40	County, RAP provides ongoing facilitation and technical assistance to several Countywide data collaborative bodies.  
41	Members of RAP participate in work groups with other criminal justice analysts to help leverage DCJ data and resources for 
42	maximum impact on the local public safety system.
43	
44	Finally, the unit is responsible for evaluating contract compliance and supporting quality improvement efforts with our 
45	community partners. These services are critical for holding programs and services accountable. Nationally, DCJ's evaluation 
46	and research findings are studied (through corrections publications and national conferences) and recognized in a manner 
47	that enhances our reputation with national and state funders.

18	The Department of Community Justice (DCJ) Human Resources (HR) unit recruits, hires, trains and assists with the 
19	management of regular, on-call, temporary employees, volunteers and interns. DCJ HR and training consultants work 
20	closely with both internal and external customers to design responsive programs and services. HR staff work with 
21	management and members of three unions to promote effective service. The HR unit directly supports the culture and 
22	mission of the Department, giving employees the tools they need to do their job and supporting management performance.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The HR unit supports approximately 545 regular and 283 temporary and on-call employees on any given day in addition to 
27	3 union contracts; and 24-hour operations in Juvenile Detention and the Multnomah County Justice Center. HR will continue 
28	to:
29	
30	1) Assess diverse organizational and customer (employee) needs to provide strategic direction as well as succession and 
31	workforce planning through active participation on management teams;
32	
33	2) Consult with managers and employees as well as manage employee and labor relations issues, that include performance 
34	management, discipline and grievances, recruitment and selection of a highly qualified and diverse workforce, personnel 
35	records, leave administration, layoffs and bumping, and compliance with County Personnel Rules, Department Work Rules, 
36	and union contracts;
37	
38	3) Ensure compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, policies and labor agreements so liability and costs of unlawful 
39	employment actions are reduced or eliminated.
40	
41	The HR unit is tasked with developing and implementing HR initiatives with Central Human Resources and Labor Relations, 
42	coordinating internal employee investigations, policies and procedures, training, safety, Health Insurance Portability and

17	Providing justice involved adults with alcohol and drug treatment in conjunction with wraparound services is an effective 
18	strategy to reduce re-offense, especially for those classified as high risk. These services can include outpatient treatment. 
19	Alcohol/drug and mental health treatment addresses a major criminal risk factor and is a necessary correctional intervention 
20	if DCJ is to continue to be successful in reducing recidivism. Other services such as vocational assistance, mentoring, and 
21	housing are also essential in promoting client success. 
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	This program offer supports a recovery system of care which includes comprehensive support for recovery in addition to 
26	treatment, such as stable and drug free housing, peer mentors, and vocational assistance. A recovery system of care better 
27	supports long-term behavior change than treatment alone. Alcohol and drug treatment services are provided through 
28	contracts with non-profit providers. Contracted treatment programs are equipped to respond to culturally-specific needs and 
29	to address criminal risk factors in addition to addiction to drugs or alcohol.  
30	
31	With the expansion of Medicaid and private forms of insurance, some clinical services previously supported by the DCJ 
32	budget are reimbursed through health insurance. DCJ will continue to provide funding for clinical services for individuals 
33	eligible for treatment who do not have insurance. In addition, funding is provided to support treatment interventions for 
34	criminal risk factors such as antisocial thoughts and attitudes, antisocial peers, impulsivity and poor problem solving skills, 
35	anger management and so on. Effective interventions for adults should integrate addictions treatment with treatment for 
36	criminality. Without treatment, justice involved adults are more likely to re-offend and/or to occupy expensive jail beds. 
37	Treatment has been proven to be effective at reducing recidivism both in Oregon and nationally.

18	Residential drug treatment is an essential part of the alcohol and drug treatment continuum that impacts public safety. 
19	When residential treatment is successful for adults, the long-term collateral costs of re-arrest, re-incarceration and 
20	inadvertent consequences for the children of justice involved adults significantly declines. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	This program supports residential drug and alcohol treatment for high risk male and female adults and allows courts and 
25	Parole-Probation Officers to have sanction options other than jail for those needing treatment. Fifty-four beds serve high risk 
26	adults in a facility specialized in treating males involved with the criminal justice system. The remaining beds for men are 
27	located in three residential facilities within the community. Some of these beds are reserved for specific populations (e.g., 
28	justice involved adults convicted of sex crimes, East County property offenses). This program also provides 27 residential 
29	alcohol and drug treatment beds for high risk female adults in two facilities and four beds for dependent children. The 
30	current community treatment providers have been in existence for over 20 years and work collaboratively with the 
31	Department of Community Justice (DCJ) to treat adults with addictions and criminality.
32	
33	The program uses evidence-based practices to address addiction, mental health issues, parenting skills, healthy 
34	relationship dynamics, criminality, employment resources and relapse prevention counseling. Regular communication and 
35	coordination with a Parole-Probation Officer (PPO) is maintained to develop and implement treatment and supervision 
36	plans. 
37	
38	With the expansion of Medicaid and private forms of insurance, some clinical services previously supported by the DCJ 
39	budget are now being reimbursed through health insurance. DCJ will continue to provide funding for clinical services for 
40	those adults eligible for treatment who do not have insurance. In addition, funding is provided to support room and board 
41	costs not covered by Medicaid for all DCJ clients served by contracted services.
42	
43	The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports that drug abuse treatment is cost effective in reducing drug use and 
44	bringing about cost savings associated with health care, crime and incarceration. NIDA also reports that gender-specific 
45	programs may be more effective for female adults, especially those with trauma and abuse in their background (2006).

17	The ability to communicate on existing public safety communication networks increases the safety of Parole-Probation 
18	Officers (PPOs), justice-involved individuals and other members of the community. Hand-held radios are the tool that PPOs 
19	use to access public safety communication networks. Changes in technology mean that the radios currently used by DCJ 
20	will begin experiencing network connection difficulties in late 2019.  
21	
22	Program Summary
23	DCJs current model, the Motorola XTS 2500 was purchased by the agency in 2011. Some units were recently donated by 
24	the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office after they transitioned to updated models in the summer of 2018. The XTS 2500 is 
25	scheduled to be discontinued by the manufacturer for parts and service/maintenance in October of 2019. This model is 
26	limited in digital features and is technologically behind all local law enforcement agencies models and creates difficulties in 
27	communication with community partners as well as potential safety risks. In 2019, both Clackamas and Washington 
28	Counties will be upgrading to new radios that will not allow us to communicate with these agencies by radio.
29	
30	Replacing DCJs current inventory of radios with an upgraded model is necessary to allow PPOs to continue to access 
31	existing public safety communication networks. Communication on these networks increases the safety of PPOs when they 
32	are working in the community by allowing them to quickly request assistance and allows dispatch to monitor their location 
33	and send assistance if officers do not respond to inquiries about their status. Use of radios also allows PPOs to quickly 
34	request assistance for justice-involved individuals and other members of the community as needed, leading to increased 
35	safety and a faster response to medical needs.

17	The Treatment First program is the next generation of diversion court. It builds on the established STOP (Sanction, 
18	Treatment, Opportunity, and Progress) model Drug Court and provides outpatient treatment and supervision. Treatment 
19	First utilizes validated risk and needs assessment tools, and provides separate tracks for individuals with differing risk and 
20	need levels. Adults charged with drug offenses are held accountable while receiving the opportunity for treatment. Those 
21	who successfully complete treatment and court requirements have their charges dismissed.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Treatment First Program is a collaborative effort between DCJ, the courts, the DA's office, the public defender's office, 
26	local law enforcement, and community treatment providers. The program involves the use of a validated risk and needs 
27	assessment tool and serves a mixed population of low risk/need and moderate to high risk/need individuals. The program 
28	provides quadrant levels and separate group treatment services to ensure low risk individuals are not attending group 
29	sessions with moderate and high risk individuals and that their specific needs are met. Defendants with low risk and low 
30	needs will be assigned to a low supervision track. The Treatment First model reserves the STOP Court for the highest need, 
31	highest risk individuals while creating alternative tracks that match program design to individuals' needs and profiles. By 
32	creating multiple treatment tracks besides the STOP Court, the county is able to provide an appropriate system response to 
33	individuals who are non-addicted and/or low-risk. 
34	
35	DCJ's contribution to the Treatment First program is the Assessment Team, which consists of  3 Parole-Probation Officers 
36	(PPO) who assess all incoming Treatment First drug cases using evidence-based risk assessment tools. These 
37	assessments are used to place incoming justice involved individuals (JIIs) in the level of supervision that research shows to 
38	be the most effective for their level of risk and specific A&D need. The assessment team assess JIIs both in and out of 
39	custody, and works closely with the Court, DA's Office and Defense Bar during the early Court process. Those placed in the 
40	STOP Court are supervised by a total of 3 PPOs. 
41	
42	STOP serves adults charged with various drug-related offenses. Multnomah County's Drug Court is one of the oldest of its 
43	kind that collaborates with criminal justice partners to expedite the court process and offer drug treatment and is one 
44	component of the Treatment First Program. The treatment component is facilitated by a contracted agency who works 
45	closely with the court to provide mental health and drug treatment, employment resources, housing referrals, mentoring, 
46	residential treatment referrals and long-term follow-up services. The STOP Court is also staffed by PPOs who support the 
47	court by offering supervision, sanction and services. Participants may attend STOP as frequently as once a week during the 
48	first phases of their recovery and as little as one time per month as they stabilize with treatment.

18	Adult Services Management (ASM) provides leadership and direction for the supervision of approximately 12,000 justice 
19	involved adults in the community annually. It is responsible for implementing evidence-based practices, managing risk, 
20	creating service standards, coordinating with public safety partners and ensuring the safety of department staff who 
21	supervise justice involved adults.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Adult Services Division (ASD) managers are responsible for regulating policy, maintaining quality services and 
26	implementing evidence-based and core correctional practices that reduce crime. They partner with other public safety 
27	representatives and community stakeholders through the Local Public Safety Coordinating Council, Criminal Justice 
28	Advisory Council, Oregon Association of Community Corrections Directors, and Oregon Department of Corrections (DOC). 
29	This program offer supports critical oversight and leadership for our adult services staff to achieve reductions in recidivism.
30	
31	Our priority is to focus resources on the highest risk and highest need individuals. The Department is utilizing current and 
32	evidence based assessment tools that:  
33	1) guide supervision by identifying criminogenic risk and need factors, and 
34	2) help develop case plans that reduce risk to re-offend. 
35	
36	Establishing a good relationship with the justice involved adults and then providing them with structured directions are key 
37	factors to reducing recidivism (Andrews & Bonita, 2006). In the coming year, ASD will focus on maintaining evidence-based 
38	practices including specialized assessment tools and cognitive behavioral intervention programming, utilizing case 
39	management strategies that provide individuals the opportunity to change by addressing factors which research has shown 
40	to reduce criminal behavior (National Institute of Corrections, 2017)

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	The Adult Recognizance (Recog) unit and Pretrial Services Program (PSP) unit both perform functions necessary for public 
19	safety and the effective operation of the local justice system. By assessing a defendants probability to appear in court or re-
20	offend and conducting interviews and assessments to determine release eligibility, the Recog and Pretrial units allow for 
21	scarce jail beds to be reserved for higher risk justice involved adults.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Recog unit is a 24-hour, seven day a week program that is housed at the County Jail. From expedited release for low 
26	risk defendants, to detention holds, to in depth custody placement, Recog staff have the knowledge, expertise, and tools 
27	necessary to make preliminary decisions in the best interest of the community. They interview defendants who have a 
28	pending Multnomah County charge, which in turn provides a comprehensive, objective, and valid system for release 
29	decisions based on victim and community safety along with the defendants flight risk. Defendants charged with felonies 
30	and/or person-to-person misdemeanor crimes are subject to a full criminal history and warrant check in addition to the 
31	standard risk screening.
32	
33	The screening tool used to guide Recog staff has been validated by an independent research group and the results of that 
34	study have been approved by the Community Justice Advisory Council. In addition to evaluating the likelihood of appearing 
35	in court and risk for committing a new crime, Recog staff assist the court with release decisions for defendants that are 
36	ineligible for release by Recog staff. The unit serves as a 24-hour link between law enforcement agencies and Parole-
37	Probation officers, by coordinating the process of holding parole and probation violators in jail and providing after-hours 
38	information on high risk individuals who are on electronic monitoring. 
39	
40	The primary mission of the PSP unit is to evaluate the risk of releasing defendants prior to trial, to monitor defendants in the 
41	community and to ensure that defendants attend court hearings. PSP staff use evidence based criteria during their 
42	investigations to determine whether or not a defendant is likely to pose a safety risk or further is likely to attend subsequent 
43	court hearings. The results of these investigations are presented back to the Court when necessary. When the defendant is 
44	released under PSP supervision, the assigned case manager monitors the defendants behavior and actions through office 
45	visits, telephone contacts and in some instances, electronic and Global Positioning Software (GPS) is used.

17	The Department of Community Justice (DCJ) is statutorily and legislatively mandated to provide services to local control 
18	(LC) justice involved individuals in order to carry out the Local Supervisory Authority (LSA) functions. The LC Release unit is 
19	instrumental in providing all LSA functions including, but not limited to investigations, issuance of warrants, release 
20	planning, and active supervision. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The LC unit supervises justice-involved individuals who are sentenced to a prison term of 12 months or less in a local jail. 
25	Working with the Sheriff's Office, the LC Release unit has the legal authority to issue arrest warrants and has jurisdiction 
26	over the supervision conditions for these justice involved individuals. LC  Release staff develop release plans and monitor 
27	adults with community-based sanctions (such as drug and alcohol treatment programs) upon the completion of their 
28	incarceration.
29	
30	The LC Release unit is instrumental in holding justice involved individuals accountable by providing fair and objective 
31	investigations and parole hearings, incarceration when appropriate and providing supervision. Through collaboration with 
32	the Sheriff's Office, the Oregon State Board of Parole, treatment providers, and the community, this unit provides effective 
33	interventions and helps to ensure efficient operations of the local justice system.

21	provides effective interventions and helps to ensure efficient operations of the local justice system.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	If during supervision, a Parole-Probation Officer (PPO) determines that a justice-involved adult has violated parole 
26	conditions, the PPO submits required written documents and a violation hearing is arranged through the Hearings unit. 
27	Hearings Officers (HO) conduct local parole hearings and determine consequences for the adults found in violation of 
28	supervision. HOs are able to order jail releases, recommend revocations of adults and/or make other recommendations that 
29	are consistent with evidence-based practices.
30	
31	In addition, the unit provides support within the Justice Center to field PPO's for the purposes of testimony and DCJ

17	The Assessment and Referral Center (ARC) combines in-custody interviews, intakes (post prison and probation) 
18	orientations and specialized services, for those released from state and local custody. Enhanced transition services 
19	provided at the ARC reduces duplication of efforts and increases the amount of screenings, referrals, and re-entry services 
20	available when an individual is first placed on supervision (Post-Prison or Probation).
21	
22	 
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The ARC staff meets with justice-involved individuals pre and post release who are considered high risk to re-offend in order 
26	to determine which strategies and services are most appropriate to connect with at release to reduce the risk of recidivism. 
27	Results indicate that using tailored referrals and re-entry services reduces re-offending and increases engagement. 
28	Coordinated and immediate service delivery pre and post release addresses individuals' needs and enables interventions 
29	targeting criminogenic factors to be delivered more effectively.
30	
31	ARC staff meet with the majority of justice involved individuals prior to their release from prison (reach-in visits), reducing 
32	the abscond rate for post-prison releases. Potential risks and strengths are identified during reach-in sessions, allowing for 
33	the development of appropriate supervision plans and preparation for potential roadblocks that could impede an individuals 
34	successful transition. In addition to state custody, this practice includes some adults in local jails and residential treatment. 
35	
36	ARC actively works to build partnerships with community based services and organizations, as well as other Multnomah 
37	County Departments, including the Health Assessment Team (HAT) located at the ARC, to provide the continuum of care 
38	that is needed for recently released individuals, including housing, health assessments, treatment access, case coordination

18	Results indicate that using client specific referrals and re-entry services including housing placement reduces recidivism 
19	and increases engagement. Coordinated and immediate service delivery including housing post- release addresses client 
20	needs and ensures interventions addressing criminogenic factors and social determinants of health are delivered effectively.

22	Program Summary
23	
24	Ending homelessness and maintaining community safety is synonymous for Transition Services, Department of Community 
25	Justice. Placing high risk, high need offenders directly into housing with services upon release are consistent with the 
26	current Multnomah County plan to end homelessness by circumventing individuals entry into homelessness and cycling in 
27	and out of incarceration.
28	
29	Evidence based practices clearly dictate the need to provide case management, access to healthcare, safe and secure 
30	housing for justice involved individuals (JIIs) releasing from jail, prison or residential treatment. Currently, there is capacity to 
31	provide short and long-term housing services for an average of 330 high-risk adults identified with behavioral or medical 
32	needs using several contracted agencies within our community. Providing housing to JIIs is cost effective. On average, the 
33	cost to house an individual is $38.00 daily, as compared to $150-170 per day to incarcerate an individual in jail or prison.

17	Housing is an important component for justice-involved individuals to be successful upon re-entry. Restoration of 18 beds at 
18	Central City Concerns Shoreline would ensure that beds are available for those justice-involved individuals who have 
19	limited housing choices. 
20	
21	Program Summary
22	Ending homelessness and maintaining community safety is synonymous for DCJs Transition Services. Placing high risk, 
23	high need offenders directly into housing with services upon release are consistent with the current Multnomah County plan 
24	to end homelessness by circumventing individuals entry into homelessness and cycling in and out of incarceration.
25	
26	With the scarcity of housing for justice-involved individuals it is important to maintain all housing options while research is 
27	done to identify more affordable options. This offer would restore the numbers of beds at the Shoreline to 62.
28	
29	As renovation work begins at the East County campus and with staff eventually being moved permanently into the North 
30	and West buildings on that campus, more justice-involved individuals will be supervised out of this office. A goal will be to 
31	continue to work with providers to increase housing options in East County, which would likely be more affordable as well as 
32	closer to where justice-involved individuals are living and receiving services.
33	
34	DCJ will continue to increase partnerships with other County departments, such as the Joint Office of Homeless Services 
35	and Mental Health and Addiction Services, and housing providers to identify housing in this area. The goal will be to identify 
36	more affordable housing than the current options of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) in downtown Portland. This past year 
37	additional beds were provided in East County by the opening of the Diane Wade House. In addition, the Joint Office of 
38	Homeless Services opened a temporary shelter in the South Building of the East Campus and is working to open a

18	Justice Reinvestment is a statewide initiative that seeks to improve public safety by reducing spending on incarceration in 
19	order to reinvest savings in evidence-based strategies at the county level that decrease crime. The program has established 
20	a process to assess justice involved adults prior to sentencing that provide a continuum of community-based sanctions, 
21	services and programs designed to reduce recidivism and decrease the countys utilization of imprisonment in Department 
22	of Corrections (DOC) institutions while protecting public safety and holding individuals accountable.  
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Defendants facing a prison term who meet the eligibility requirements are identified by the District Attorney. The Multnomah 
27	County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP) includes funding for the jail to expedite assessments, for the court and the 
28	defense to assist with case coordination and scheduling, a deputy district attorney to facilitate case identification and case 
29	management, law enforcement to assist DCJ in monitoring individuals before and after sentencing, and additional staff at 
30	DCJ to carry out the program (assessment, report writing, and supervision). Also, 10% of the funding for Multnomah County 
31	must be appropriated to a non-profit working with crime victims. 
32	
33	DCJ conducts an objective assessment of criminal risk and makes recommendations for how the individual could be 
34	managed in the community. This report is provided to the defense, prosecution, and court prior to sentencing and informs 
35	the sentencing process. For those individuals who are sentenced to probation rather than prison, DCJ provides intensive 
36	supervision, along with referrals to treatment. The case plan is individualized based on the person's specific criminal risk 
37	factors and community stability needs. This program offer also supports the ongoing Reentry Enhancement Coordination 
38	program. This is an evidence-based addictions treatment program for people leaving prison, and includes treatment, 
39	housing, mentoring, and employment assistance. 
40	
41	In 2017, MCJRP secured a supplemental grant through CJC which addresses special populations (women and young 
42	justice involved individuals - JIIs) and second sentence programs. This additional funding provided a .5 victims advocate to 
43	the prosecution, a district attorney to review all probation violations to inform revocations, and two positions with the 
44	Defense to support JIIs accessing services and programs pre-adjudication. The MCJRP Law Enforcement (LE) Team 
45	comprised of two officers is also funded through this supplemental grant. To affect women, there are two Community Health 
46	Specialists who are trained in providing gender-informed services, trauma informed care and are skilled at helping the JJI 
47	navigate the health and mental health systems, as well as other resources in the community. They work in tandem with the 
48	gender responsive Parole-Probation Officer.

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	Multnomah County Department of Community Justice (DCJ) High Risk Generic Supervision has been nationally recognized 
19	for the use of evidence-based strategies, including the development of a system to identify criminogenic risk factors 
20	affiliated with High Risk justice involved adults. Multnomah County receives a greater number of high risk individuals than 
21	any other Oregon county and is still able to produce lower recidivism rates for our cases.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	High Risk Supervision uses research-based strategies to supervise high-risk individuals on probation and parole. DCJ 
26	utilizes the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI), the Womens Risk Need Assessment (WRNA) and 
27	Public Safety Checklist (PSC) assessment tools to measure the risks and needs of adult. The LS/CMI is also a fully 
28	functioning case management tool. The LS/CMI provides a summary of the individuals static and dynamic criminogenic risk 
29	and need factors, as well as special responsivity considerations to be deployed during supervision. The WRNA is a gender-
30	responsive risk assessment created with justice involved womens social and psychological needs in mind. The PSC 
31	provides a quick, objective, validated assessment of the probability an individual will be re-convicted of a felony or re-
32	arrested for a person or property offense based on specific characteristics. 
33	
34	DCJ continues to use Effective Practices in Corrections Setting (EPICS), an evidence-based case management model. 
35	With EPICS, Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) follow a structured approach to their interactions with their clients, allowing 
36	PPOs to effectively target the criminogenic needs using cognitive behavioral interventions for high risk individuals. PPOs 
37	reinforce law-abiding behavior and link clients to treatment, employment and other services. Supervision is conducted 
38	through: a) home and office visits; b) contacts with family; c) correspondence with community members and treatment 
39	providers; and d) collaboration with law enforcement agencies.
40	 
41	Adult supervision is an essential component of public safety. Nearly all prison inmates return to their county of sentencing 
42	upon release, where they must complete post-prison supervision. The risk of these individuals committing new crimes is 
43	reduced when evidence-based supervision is in place and monitored. Implementing effective supervision practices has 
44	contributed to lower recidivism rates as compared to the Statewide average.

18	The Mental Health Unit (MHU) provides supervision services for probation, parole and post-prison individuals who have 
19	been diagnosed with a severe and persistent mental illness. The MHU unit works in collaboration with a variety of 
20	community partners including but not limited to the Sheriffs Office, the Courts, the Department of County Human Services 
21	(DCHS), the Local Public Safety Coordinating Committee (LPSCC), Oregon Department of Corrections (DOC), Portland 
22	Police, treatment providers and community groups that work with this population. 
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The MHU unit works to divert justice involved adults with severe mental illness from incarceration and hospitalizations by 
27	treating them in the community. By providing these individuals with community-based treatment and with supervision from 
28	specially trained Parole-Probation Officers (PPOs), the MHU unit preserves community safety and minimizes individuals 
29	contact with the criminal justice system. The goal of the MHU unit is to reduce recidivism, enhance community safety and to 
30	support the mentally ill client in achieving stabilization and improved functioning.
31	
32	The MHU unit performs the following:
33	1) Improves access to appropriate services for people with severe mental illness who are at high risk of criminal justice 
34	involvement;
35	2) Reduces jail and hospital admissions;
36	3) Assists individuals in achieving an improved quality of life outside of jails, prisons and hospitals;
37	4) Provides ongoing monitoring and surveillance; and
38	5) Reduces substance abuse and illicit drug use.
39

17	The Sex Offense Supervision and Treatment program is a critical public safety function that provides oversight for the 
18	comprehensive supervision, treatment and management of approximately 770 adults convicted of sex offenses annually 
19	living in Multnomah County. The priorities of this unit are to increase community safety, decrease sexual victimization and 
20	reduce recidivism. This program achieves these goals through evidence-based supervision strategies combined with sexual 
21	offense specific treatment practices.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Evidence-based supervision of individuals convicted of sex offenses is conducted by certified Sex Offense Specialist 
26	Parole-Probation Officers (PPO). High and medium risk individuals are supervised in one field office. Individuals identified 
27	as lower risk to sexually re-offend are assigned to the Sex Offense Reduced Supervision Caseload (program offer 50037) 
28	after a period of documented compliance.
29	
30	This program requires individuals convicted of sexual offenses to participate in a comprehensive evaluation, sexual offense 
31	specific treatment and ongoing evaluation of risk provided by approved community treatment providers. Polygraph 
32	examinations are required for monitoring compliance with treatment expectations and supervision conditions.
33	
34	This program has a direct impact on community safety and maintains high standards for accountability. Research has 
35	shown individuals who successfully participate in sexual offense specific treatment are less likely to re offend than those 
36	who fail to participate in treatment (Craig et al., 2003; Hanson et al., 2009; Lovins et al., 2009; McGrath et al., 2003). Sexual 
37	and general recidivism rates of treated individuals convicted of sexual offenses has also been shown to be lower than 
38	recidivism rates of untreated individuals convicted of sex offenses (Looman et al 2000; Hanson et al 2002). The use of 
39	polygraph examinations is invaluable in the management and treatment of individuals convicted of sex offenses due to the 
40	information gained through the examination process. Furthermore, the use of polygraph examinations is also associated 
41	with a decline in recidivism rates (Cole, 2006; Edson et al., 2007; English et al., 2000; Krueger, 2009).

15	Executive Summary
16	The Domestic Violence (DV) unit collaborates with police, District Attorneys Office, courts and treatment agencies to hold 
17	justice involved adults accountable and promote individual change. Each year, this program supervises over 1,000 adults 
18	convicted of misdemeanor and felony level offenses. In addition, the DV unit works closely with victims to empower them to 
19	make changes that improve their lives as well as the lives of their families. Over the past year, 87% of individuals 
20	supervised by the DV unit have not committed a new misdemeanor or felony.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The DV unit strives to end the cycle of violence by holding individuals accountable for their actions and giving them the 
25	opportunity to make long-term positive changes by engaging in appropriate counseling groups (batterer intervention, mental 
26	health, etc.). In addition to working with individuals to address behavior change, Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) in the DV 
27	unit work closely with victims to develop safety plans that help empower them to break the cycle of domestic violence. DV 
28	PPOs regularly attend court to ensure a systematic approach is being utilized in victim safety and accountability of the 
29	individual on supervision.
30	
31	Reducing domestic violence is a priority for Multnomah County. This program increases public safety by holding high risk 
32	individuals accountable, promoting victim safety and building strong collaborative efforts with community partners. This 
33	program utilizes evidence-based practices including specialized assessment tools and cognitive behavioral intervention 
34	programming that is proven to reduce intimate partner violence. Case management strategies provide individuals the 
35	opportunity to change by addressing factors which research has shown to reduce criminal behavior (National Institute of 
36	Corrections, 2017).

17	The Women & Family Services Unit (WFSU) supervises approximately 670 justice involved adults annually, and most of 
18	them are women. A number of these individuals are pregnant women and/or have children involved in the juvenile justice 
19	system. By collaborating with community partners, including the Juvenile Services Division (JSD), WFSU protects children 
20	and works to break the cycle of cross-generational antisocial behavior and crime. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	WFSU is a unique program that approaches supervision through a multi-disciplinary team effort. WFSU works closely with 
25	staff from Child Welfare, Self Sufficiency, Health Services, the Juvenile Services Division, and mental health agencies. 
26	WFSU emphasizes collaboration with other agencies for case planning, resource allocation and efficient service delivery. 
27	Integrating supervision, child welfare, the Family Court, benefits assistance, social and health services as well as addiction 
28	treatment allows WFSU to efficiently address dynamics that place an entire family at risk. WFSU also utilizes the Womens 
29	Risk Need Assessment to appropriately assess each womans actual risk and need areas. This tool allows WFSU staff to 
30	be more effective with cognitive behavioral interventions, as well as treatment and service referrals.
31	
32	The Family Support project, a community-based component, reduces recidivism through accountability, education and 
33	training, prioritization of self sufficiency and child welfare, and facilitating access to necessary treatment or counseling. 
34	WFSUs approach strengthens the family's resistance to future involvement in the criminal justice system and successfully 
35	defrays long-term costs associated with inter-generational criminal activity.
36	
37	House Bill 3503 established the Family Sentencing Alternative Pilot (FSAP) Program. This program is also included in the 
38	Women & Family Services Unit, which diverts qualified justice involved adults who have primary custody of a minor child at 
39	the time of the offense from prison to probation. The intent of this program is to promote reunification of families, prevent 
40	children from entering the foster care system, and holding individuals accountable, while utilizing wrap around services, with 
41	a primary focus of parenting. WFSU has 4 staff dedicated to working with clients who are either pregnant or parenting, or 
42	attempting to parent their children, through Department of Human Services involvement. The rest of WFSU staff focus on 
43	women involved in the criminal justice system, who are not parenting, the majority due to termination of parental rights 
44	through the court system. New this year is the Diane Wade House transitional housing program for women involved in the 
45	criminal justice system, funded through the MacArthur Foundation. It provides gender-responsive, trauma-informed services 
46	that are also Afrocentric. Residents, who must be referred to the program, will have access to culturally specific mental 
47	health stabilization and support services.

17	The Change Center (CC) is a cost-effective public safety program that serves moderate and high risk, violent, mentally ill 
18	and drug addicted adults who are on probation and parole. The Change Center provides educational and employment 
19	services as well as cognitive behavioral skill-based programming  through group sessions
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	The program works with moderate and high-risk justice involved adults who have been released from incarceration or who 
24	have been referred to the program by their Parole-Probation Officer (PPO). The program works to address relevant 
25	criminogenic need areas to help participants succeed on supervision and become successful in the community. The Change 
26	Center has group locations in both Downtown and East Portland. The program utilizes several evidence-based curricula for 
27	both men and womens groups. The Change Center also provides specialized assistance focused on employment. The 
28	Change Center participants receive services designed to address risky situations and challenging life circumstances such 
29	as substance abuse, criminal thinking and attitudes, inadequate work skills and lack of stability and/or pro-social support. 
30	
31	Additionally, training staff for all cognitive behavioral curricula and program practices ensures common understanding of the

17	Electronic Monitoring (EM) allows staff to monitor the activities of pre- and post-adjudicated individuals in the community 
18	through house arrest, curfew monitoring, alcohol consumption monitoring, or the monitoring of an individual's movement in 
19	the community. Utilizing EM and Global Positioning Software (GPS) technology to monitor the movements of justice 
20	involved adults within the community has proven to be a reliable, cost-effective way to sanction individuals and reinforce 
21	public safety and the safety of victims.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	EM technologies are useful case management tools that allow for a broader range of responses to non-conformance and 
26	an alternative to more expensive incarceration during pre-adjudication and post-conviction. EM allows Parole-Probation 
27	Officers (PPO) to know where high risk justice involved adults are located at any given time. This alternative sanction 
28	expands supervision sentencing options for judges and creates cost-effective client management by having the individual 
29	pay a portion of the equipment costs (based upon subsidy eligibility). Current data indicate most defendants and justice 
30	involved adults on EM complete their obligation successfully. Last year, DCJ clients were on EM instead of using nearly 
31	60,000 jail bed days.
32	
33	This use of EM technology further allows an individual the ability to maintain employment and continue participation in 
34	treatment groups. The EM Program is staffed by Correction Technicians (CTs) and provides case management assistance 
35	to PPOs by installing the bracelets, monitoring compliance, responding to program violations and communicating violations 
36	to PPOs, and maintaining an EM database.
37	
38	The EM program is a collaborative, systems-oriented project that works closely with PPOs Pretrial Supervision Program 
39	staff who in turn work with the Courts, the Oregon Board of Parole and Post Prison Supervision and the District Attorney's 
40	Office to enhance the success of individuals placed on community supervision.

17	Many individuals who commit property crimes are also addicted to alcohol or drugs. In an attempt to decrease additional 
18	felony convictions and hold people accountable both the State Department of Corrections and the Oregon Criminal Justice 
19	Commission invested monies into comprehensive programming for this population. The funding agencies conduct 
20	evaluations of each program and report back to the legislature on the results.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	DCJ has redesigned this program to include a targeted focus on high risk, opioid-dependent adults and the difficulty in 
25	successfully treating these individuals. A close partnership with a qualified community-based program enhances our ability 
26	to safely manage these justice involved adults while reducing overdose deaths and criminal recidivism.
27	
28	The Success Through Accountability, Restitution, and Treatment (START) court is multi-disciplinary in nature, and money is 
29	shared by multiple stakeholders. The START program is selective, and provides wrap-around services including treatment, 
30	supervision, and transition planning, and mentorship. It uses evidence-based practices in collaboration with the Courts, 
31	Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, defense attorneys, the District Attorney, Volunteers of America, and DCJ. This program

18	The Adult Community Service Program (CS) provides an effective, cost-efficient sentence / sanction that is available to the 
19	Courts and Parole-Probation Officers. CS promotes public safety by engaging justice involved individuals in a pro-social 
20	occupation of their time, as well as teaching pro-social skills and promoting anti-criminal thinking patterns. CS assists 
21	individuals with their court mandated obligations of community service work, and provides sanctioning services to 
22	individuals on bench probation, formal probation and post-prison supervision. 
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Community Service provides the Courts and Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) with a cost-effective method of holding 
27	individuals accountable while providing reparations for the community. Individuals are referred to Community Service by the 
28	Courts for both Bench and Formal Supervision and by PPOs. Courts sentence adults to Community Service as a condition 
29	of probation and PPOs can sanction individuals to complete Community Service as a consequence of a supervision 
30	violation. Many non-profit community organizations use individuals in this program for non-paid work. Along with being an 
31	alternative sanction to jail, Community Service also provides clients the chance to give back by improving the livability of the 
32	community through the work that is accomplished in this program.  
33	
34	In addition to alternative sanctions and allowing individuals the opportunity to give back to the community, Community 
35	Service also allows individuals to pay back victims of crimes by them earning money with the Restitution Work Crew 
36	program. This program will ensure individual accountability to pay back the victims of their crimes.  
37	
38	The Juvenile CS program has two components: Community Service and Project Payback. Youth do landscaping work and 
39	litter clean-up in much needed areas. The Juvenile Community Service/Project Payback Program provides youth with the 
40	ability to fulfill their Court mandated obligation while earning money to pay their ordered restitution. Over the past year, the 
41	Juvenile CS crews worked approximately 8,300 hours in the community and paid approximately $46,450 in payments to the 
42	Court and individual victims for restitution. Both Community Service and Project Payback provide youth with a pro-social 
43	activity while teaching valuable skills. Youth learn landscaping techniques, hand/power tool use and maintenance, and how 
44	to safely and efficiently accomplish tasks.

17	High risk African American men and women returning to their communities from prison and placed on supervision are over 
18	represented in the criminal justice system. DCJ is committed to addressing systemic racism that creates unnecessary 
19	barriers for black community members. Lack of education, employment experience, supportive housing coupled with 
20	returning to communities that may present some of the same anti-social influences have a negative impact on successful 
21	reentry into the community. 
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	This program addresses the needs of African American men and women and gang involved adults. The Department of 
26	Community Justice (DCJ) works with culturally responsive providers who have demonstrated effectiveness in improving 
27	outcomes for African American justice involved men and women who are 18 to 45 years of age in the areas of education, 
28	employment, culturally responsive cognitive behavioral therapy and family stability. This target population is under 
29	supervision with (DCJ) Adult Services Division African American Program and Gang Unit. Providers engage in cognitive 
30	behavior therapy, peer mentoring, parenting, employment and educational services designed to change the way people 
31	think and behave.
32	
33	Cognitive interventions are a systematic approach that seeks to overcome difficulties by identifying and changing 
34	dysfunctional thinking, behavior and emotional responses. This involves helping individuals develop skills for modifying 
35	beliefs, identifying distorted thinking, relating to others in different ways, and changing behaviors. The provider utilizes 
36	mentors to assist clients with navigating complex systems such as education and employment. Mentoring helps adults 
37	establish stable lives by reducing the chaos brought about by poverty, homelessness, underemployment as well as the 
38	effects of incarceration. Gang members have shown an increased willingness to participate in programs that use mentors 
39	that have had similar life experiences as their own. The relationship that develops between the mentor and the gang 
40	member is a key factor for engaging with pro-social resources, relationships and behavior change.
41	
42	Individuals assigned to this program are classified as high risk based on their scores by the Public Safety Checklist and the 
43	LSCMI. They are also identified prior to being released from prison as gang members based on an established set of 
44	criteria. Cognitive interventions follow the Habilitation Empowerment Accountability Therapy (HEAT) curriculum, a culturally 
45	responsive cognitive behavioral intervention program designed to reflect and address the unique experiences and needs of 
46	participants, respectively.

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	Multnomah County Department of Community Justice (DCJ) High Risk Generic Supervision has been nationally recognized 
18	for the use of evidence-based strategies, including the development of a system to identify criminogenic risk factors 
19	affiliated with High Risk justice involved adults. The Monitored Misdemeanor Program (MMP) promotes public safety by 
20	monitoring and supervising justice involved adults on bench probation who have been convicted of Driving Under the 
21	Influence of Intoxicants (DUII). MMP is instrumental in holding bench probation clients accountable.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	High Risk Supervision uses research-based strategies to supervise high-risk individuals on probation and parole. DCJ 
26	utilizes the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI), the Womens Risk Need Assessment (WRNA) and 
27	Public Safety Checklist (PSC) assessment tools to measure the risks and needs of adult. The LS/CMI provides a summary 
28	of the individuals static and dynamic criminogenic risk and need factors, as well as special responsivity considerations to be 
29	deployed during supervision. The WRNA is a gender-responsive risk assessment created with justice involved womens 
30	social and psychological needs in mind. The PSC provides a quick, objective, validated assessment of the probability an 
31	individual will be re-convicted of a felony or re-arrested for a person or property offense based on specific characteristics. 
32	
33	DCJ continues to use Effective Practices in Corrections Setting (EPICS) as an evidence-based case management model. 
34	With EPICS, Parole-Probation Officers (PPOs) reinforce law-abiding behavior and link clients to treatment, employment and 
35	other services. Supervision is conducted through: a) home and office visits; b) contacts with family; c) correspondence with 
36	community members and treatment providers; and d) collaboration with law enforcement agencies.
37	 
38	Nearly all prison inmates return to their county of sentencing upon release, where they must complete post-prison 
39	supervision. The risk of these individuals committing new crimes is reduced when evidence-based supervision is in place 
40	and monitored. Implementing effective supervision practices has contributed to lower recidivism rates as compared to the 
41	Statewide average. 
42	
43	The Monitored Misdemeanor Program (MMP) provides a service to the courts by monitoring police contacts with individuals 
44	supervised in this DUII program. This allows the Court to respond more quickly and effectively with individuals on DUII 
45	supervision.

17	The DV unit strives to end the cycle of violence by holding justice involved adults accountable for their actions and giving 
18	them the opportunity to make long-term positive changes by engaging in appropriate counseling groups (batterer 
19	intervention, mental health, etc.). In addition to working with individuals to address behavior change, Parole-Probation 
20	Officers (PPO) in the DV unit work closely with victims to develop safety plans that help empower them to break the cycle of 
21	domestic violence.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Related to program offer 50026, this program offer provides two critical service components to the Domestic Violence (DV) 
26	unit:
27	
28	1) Individuals with first time offenses of domestic violence are placed in the Deferred Sentencing Program (DSP). DSP 
29	provides individuals access to services that help address their violent behavior patterns. If an individual successfully 
30	completes all requirements of DSP, he/she is not convicted of the initial offense and the case is dismissed.
31	
32	2) DSP refers DV defendants to intervention services for batterers, which helps prevent their behavior from escalating into 
33	further contacts with law enforcement and subsequent stays in costly jails.
34	
35	DV PPOs regularly attend court to ensure a collaborative approach is being utilized in victim safety and client accountability. 
36	Reducing domestic violence is a priority for Multnomah County. This program increases public safety by holding individuals 
37	accountable, promoting victim safety and building strong collaborative efforts with community partners. This program utilizes 
38	evidence-based practices including specialized assessment tools and cognitive behavioral intervention programming. Case 
39	management strategies provide individuals the opportunity to change by addressing factors which research has shown to 
40	reduce criminal behavior (National Institute of Corrections, 2017).

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	The Sex Offense Reduced Supervision (SORS) caseload provides supervision for adults convicted of sex offenses who 
18	have been identified as low risk for sexual re-offense by validated risk assessment tools. A reduced level of supervision is 
19	provided to qualifying clients in order to monitor compliance with sexual offense specific treatment, sex offense registration 
20	and special conditions of supervision. This caseloads staff assists with community safety by reducing risk through 
21	continued monitoring of the individuals behavior while on supervision.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The SORS caseload is for adults convicted of sex offenses who have been identified as low risk for sexual re-offense. 
26	These individuals have shown compliance via:
27	
28	1) Completing a minimum of one year supervision and treatment;
29	2) Passing a full disclosure polygraph (if medically able and if no extenuating circumstances exist);
30	3) Passing a maintenance polygraph within six months prior to their transfer to the SORS caseload; and
31	4) Having a limited sexual and criminal history.
32	
33	An individual who meets any of the below criteria is excluded from SORS supervision:
34	1) Having a score of 6+ on the Static-99 assessment tool;
35	2) Having a primary sexual preference for children or sexual arousal to violence;
36	3) Having emotional identification with children; and
37	4) Level 3 Sex designation (may be waived by the manager).
38	
39	In accordance with the Risk/Need/Responsivity model, the SORS program limits the extent of resources invested in low risk 
40	individuals and focuses on allocating the majority of resources to high and medium risk adults convicted of sex offenses. 
41	One Sex Offense Specialist Parole-Probation Officer (PPO) supervises the SORS caseload and is required to complete a 
42	home visit every six months. The individual on supervision is required to submit monthly reports, report in person every six 
43	months, successfully complete a maintenance polygraph every six months, participate in sexual offense specific treatment 
44	until discharged, and pay supervision and court ordered fees. Individuals are returned to a high risk caseload if there are 
45	any indications of status instability or verified behaviors that present an increased risk to the community or victim.

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	The Reduced Supervision Team (RST) model takes care not to bring justice involved adults who are low risk deeper into the 
19	criminal justice system, provides minimal supervision and encourages increased self-sufficiency. Approximately 3000 adults 
20	are supervised by RST annually. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	Justice involved adults are assessed utilizing risk tools. Those who have the lowest risk to re-offend are routed to RST for 
25	supervision. Research shows that providing intense supervision to lower risk individuals is detrimental and causes more 
26	harm (Lowenkamp, Latessa, & Holsinger, 2006).
27	
28	RST is a formal probation/parole/post-prison program that tracks the individuals supervision to completion. The individual is 
29	not required to see a Parole-Probation Officer (PPO) but must report any changes in address or employment, any law 
30	enforcement contact, and must receive permission to travel outside of Oregon. RST monitors new criminal activity and 
31	responds with an array of sanctions or redirection, which can include a caseload transfer for more intensive supervision, 
32	jail/revocation, electronic monitoring and/or community service.
33	
34	Staff monitor and supervise individuals by tracking each case for police contact, new criminal activity and compliance to 
35	conditions set by the Court. This program's ability to monitor the activities of individuals allows the courts to effectively 
36	supervise these cases and address violations in a timely manner.

26	
27	In an effort to increase staffing efficiencies, in between late 2016 and early 2018 reception was moved to a central location 
28	on the first floor of the Mead Building. While some efficiencies have been realized, feedback from staff and justice-involved

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	This is a one time only request for $50,000 to implement and train all detention staff on a new behavior management 
18	system that will focus on increasing youth and staff safety while reducing reliance on isolation/room confinement and 
19	restraints. Mandatory training of all juvenile custody services specialists (JCSSs) is extremely expensive because of the 
20	need to backfill and provide overtime.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The behavior management system currently utilized in detention was created nearly 20 years ago. It is in need of updating 
25	to better align with modern research and science, statutes and laws, as well as national trends related to conditions of 
26	confinement.
27	
28	This year (FY 2019) we will engage a core group of JCSSs in researching and selecting a new behavior management 
29	system with a goal of implementing the new model and training all staff in FY 2020. The training will focus on increasing 
30	youth and staff safety, reducing isolation/room confinement, and providing new tools to work with youth in line with 
31	adolescent brain development science and trauma informed care. A recent Performance based Standards (PbS) survey 
32	showed that many JCSSs wanted training in this area. 
33	
34	A core group of JCSSs will participate in the development of this training. DCJ will use funds this year to cover the costs of 
35	providing backfill for the JCSSs engaged in the research and development of the behavior management model and 
36	associated training. Engaging frontline staff in researching and recommending a new model, and developing an 
37	implementation plan, will be key to gaining their support and buy in.

18	Exposure to parental conflict and the potential loss of a parent through divorce and separation places children at risk for 
19	delinquency, teen pregnancy and poor school performance, all of which can lead to a cycle of dysfunction and offending 
20	behavior. Family Court Services (FCS) helps keep children safe, parents healthy, families stable and promotes public safety 
21	through services to at risk families as they go through separation and divorce. 
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Parent Education Program (under FCS) provides divorce and parenting information to Multnomah County parents 
26	experiencing the major life transition of separation or divorce. Through parent education, mediation, evaluation, information 
27	and referral services, FCS stabilizes families involved with the Family Court and plays a critical role in preventing family 
28	dysfunction, childhood stress and juvenile delinquency.
29	
30	FCS provides child custody mediation to over 1,000 cases a year and conducts approximately 30 child custody evaluations 
31	annually to assist families experiencing high levels of conflict. FCS also produces materials such as the Birth Through 
32	Three and Second Chances handbooks for use by parents and others in need of information relevant to parenting issues. 
33	 Reducing parental conflict during separation decreases risks for delinquency and teen pregnancy, decreases subsequent 
34	litigation and increases childrens meaningful contact with both parents (Wallerstein 1998; Emery 2001; Sarkadi et al. 2008).
35	
36	FCS is housed in the Downtown Courthouse and services are taking place at East County Courthouse in order to better 
37	serve the residents of East County. Parent education and mediation are state mandated services.

19	Juvenile Justice Complex.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	This offer maintains food service by the Courtyard Cafe for the Juvenile Justice Complex. The Courtyard Caf food service 
23	has a significant positive impact on maintaining staff morale and the good will of our partners at the Juvenile Justice 
24	Complex. Many of our partners utilize the Caf for breakfast and lunch meetings between Court sessions. 
25	
26	The Caf is also a resource for families who often have to spend time at the Juvenile Justice Complex awaiting court 
27	hearings and other meetings. It provides them with an affordable and convenient option for food. Without the Caf, staff and 
28	others would have to leave to get food resulting in a loss of productivity and the ability to quickly get food and beverages. It 
29	provides a natural meeting space where DCJ staff and partners can interact to catch up on business as well as build 
30	positive relationships. 
31	
32	The Courtyard Catering Services primarily serves Multnomah County events but is available for caterings to the public as

17	Juvenile Detention protects the community by holding youth in custody when it has been determined that they are a serious 
18	risk to public safety and/or are a high risk to not appear for court. In 2018, over 674 youth were brought to Juvenile 
19	Detention for intake screening. This offer funds 48 of the 64 beds required to meet the Countys daily detention needs. 
20	
21	Program Summary
22	The Juvenile Detention facility has a capacity of 191 beds. Of the 64 beds required to meet the Countys daily detention 
23	needs, 32 beds are contracted and reserved for Clackamas and Washington Counties. The remaining 32 beds hold high 
24	risk Multnomah County youth who are NOT appropriate for community placement. Of those 64 beds, a unit of 16 beds must 
25	be kept available for youth who identify as female.
26	
27	The ability to safely detain delinquent youth is mandated by Oregon law and is essential to community protection. The 
28	decisions made to hold youth in detention are based on the results of a validated detention screening system along with 
29	policies developed collaboratively among system stakeholders. This system has saved Multnomah County millions of 
30	dollars by safely diverting lower risk youth into less costly community placement alternatives. The ability to house tri-county 
31	youth in one facility maximizes the use of space and provides the flexibility needed to structure units according to age and 
32	gender.
33	
34	Funding for these 48 detention beds allows for intake services and housing arrangements for youth who are: awaiting trial, 
35	have violated parole, have serious probation violations, or are on out-of-state holds awaiting return to their jurisdiction.

18	One of the key components for supervision of pre-adjudicated, at risk youth is to allow for qualified youth to remain at home 
19	or in community placements while awaiting court processing. The Community Monitoring Program (CMP) provides 
20	supervision and support while reserving the use of costly detention bed spaces for higher risk youth. The research 
21	published by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) shows that detaining low risk offending 
22	youth makes it more likely they will re-offend after they return to the community.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	This program serves both pre-adjudicated and post-adjudicated youth to ensure court compliance. CMP is comprised of 
27	four levels of supervision. All youth start out being placed on the highest level and are reduced in their level of supervision 
28	based on their performance.
29	
30	While on CMP, each youth must make several daily phone calls to the CMP office for required check-ins. CMP staff conduct 
31	face to face visits at home, school and place of employment (referred to as field visits) to assure program compliance and 
32	that conditions of release are being followed. Field visits are random and are conducted 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 
33	Each youth is reviewed weekly by the team to measure client compliance. The goal of the program is for each youth to 
34	comply with the court ordered release conditions and successfully complete the program.
35	
36	Multnomah County Juvenile Services Division (JSD) is a national model site for Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative 
37	(JDAI). JDAIs success is dependent on having detention alternative programs which use the least restrictive means for 
38	youth who are involved in the court process. Without a range of alternatives to detention, Multnomah County JSD would 
39	detain over 100 additional youth per year.

18	Juvenile detention alternatives in the form of short-term shelter and residential placements protect the public by safely 
19	supervising identified high risk youth in the community. Many of these are Latino and African American justice-involved 
20	youth. By placing these youth in culturally appropriate placements (short-term shelter care or treatment foster care), the 
21	disproportionate confinement of youth of color drops significantly. Juvenile shelter and residential placements additionally 
22	save the County significant funding each year while preserving public safety.
23	
24	Program Summary

26	Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 419C.145 defines the circumstances under which a youth may be placed in custody. A youth

28	conditions of release violations, or participated in certain person to person misdemeanors, is eligible for custody. Further 
29	stipulated in this statute are mandates that allow these youth to be released to a parent, shelter or other responsible party 
30	as long as their release does not endanger the welfare of the community or the youth. While in care, these youth attend 
31	school, participate in treatment and work with an assigned Juvenile Court Counselor.

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	Intake, Assessment, Intervention and Adjudication (IAIA) carries an average daily caseload of 180 youth (12 to 18 years of 
19	age). Youth who are at imminent risk of becoming chronic juvenile offenders are identified using validated risk assessment 
20	instruments; supervision and services are provided to over 260 justice involved youth annually. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	IAIA conducts daily intakes, responds to victim and public inquiries, and administers delinquency risk assessments. IAIA 
25	communicates with the District Attorneys Office regarding charging decisions, provides valuable information and referral 
26	services to the public, and facilitates victim services as mandated by Oregon Victims Rights Law. Judges rely heavily on 
27	IAIA to provide critical information and technical support for daily court docketing and proceedings. 
28	
29	IAIA staff monitor the daily court docket, assist the Juvenile Court with delinquency matters, set court proceedings in 
30	motion, and collaborate with Deputy District Attorneys, defense attorneys, State Court Clerks Office, and Judicial Officers 
31	concerning matters of law and court processes including preparation of court reports and recommendations. IAIA staff 
32	represent the Juvenile Services Division during these court proceedings.
33	
34	IAIA administers standardized, comprehensive delinquency risk assessments to identify youth who are at the highest risk to 
35	re-offend. Low and medium risk youth age 12 and older who commit low-level delinquent acts are assessed and held 
36	accountable via contracts called Formal Accountability Agreements (FAA), instead of being charged, adjudicated and placed 
37	on formal probation. FAA conditions may include community service, restitution, a letter of responsibility, school attendance 
38	and/or treatment services. IAIA youth who do not comply with agreements or who continue to demonstrate unsafe, illegal 
39	behavior can be taken to court and placed on formal probation.

18	Juvenile Field Probation (JFP) services are divided into three specialized units designed to address the unique needs of 
19	each youth population. The three units are Resource Intervention Services to Empower (RISE), Juvenile Sex Offender 
20	Probation Supervision Unit (JSOP) and Juvenile Female Probation Unit. All three units hold youth accountable through 
21	specialized supervision and sanctions, skill building, mentoring and positive age appropriate activities.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The RISE unit provides probation supervision to high risk males, gang involved youth, and youth on supervision for serious 
26	assault and weapon related charges. The JSOP unit supervises youth on supervision for sexual related charges. The 
27	Female Probation Unit focuses on providing effective gender specific case management and programming to medium and 
28	high risk adjudicated females and youth who have been identified as victims of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children 
29	(CSEC).
30	
31	Juvenile Court Counselors (JCC) develop probation case plans establishing enforceable expectations and address victim 
32	restitution. In addition to holding youth accountable, JCCs coordinate treatment (e.g. mental health and drug abuse) and 
33	interventions designed to address anti-social behavior. Skill building, mentoring, educational advocacy and the incorporation 
34	of positive age appropriate activities are all used to counteract gang involvement, sexual offending and other harmful 
35	behaviors leading to further involvement in the criminal justice system. JFP focuses on the highest risk youth by utilizing 
36	Functional Family Probation Services (FFPS), an evidence-based case management model that has proven results in 
37	reducing recidivism and promoting accountability among justice involved youth. Probations use of FFPS increases family 
38	participation in the youths supervision and treatment, and youth have increased success on supervision when family 
39	members are actively participating. Interventions that take place in this program include intensive family based counseling, 
40	specialized youth treatment, culturally appropriate services, employment training opportunities, positive peer influences and 
41	community support systems.  
42	
43	JCCs are an integral member of the Community Healing Initiative (CHI), which uses an inter-disciplinary approach to 
44	develop and implement plans for positive youth development, family support and community protection. JCCs also 
45	collaborate with Police, Adult Parole-Probation Officers and the community to gather intelligence that helps with intervention

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	Gang violence is a serious problem within Multnomah County. In 2005, the Oregon Legislature established a funding stream 
19	to enhance important law enforcement activities in the eastern part of Multnomah County via the East Metro Gang 
20	Enforcement Team (EMGET)
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	In the late 1980s, Multnomah County saw an increase in gang recruitment, drug sales, violence and gang activity. Today, 
25	gang activity is not only increasing in Multnomah County, it is spreading. Gang activity has been increasing in East County.
26	
27	EMGET includes a partnership between the Gresham Police Department and the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office.  In 
28	order to reduce the impact of criminal street gangs on citizens, schools, businesses and neighborhoods of Gresham, 
29	Fairview, Troutdale, Wood Village and unincorporated areas of east Multnomah County, EMGET exercises five major 
30	strategies: 1) provides a high level of coordinated law enforcement; 2) locates and identifies individuals affiliated with 
31	criminal street gangs; 3) gathers and shares intelligence information related to criminal street gang activity; 4) investigates 
32	crimes associated with criminal street gangs; and 5) provides an increased level of police presence in known or suspected 
33	street gang affected areas.
34	
35	EMGET conducts monthly, multi-agency, coordinated missions and holds quarterly meetings (open to the public) to release 
36	the latest numbers/data related to criminal street gang contacts, weapons seized, arrests of gang members and EMGET

18	Executive Summary
19	
20	The Assessment and Evaluation (A&E) Program is a Behavioral Rehabilitation Services (BRS) short term residential 
21	program designed to provide temporary structure, stabilization and treatment readiness. The assessment and evaluation 
22	program serves youth who may otherwise be in detention awaiting a community placement. The goal of this program is to 
23	provide a safe place where youth and family can make longer term plans for the youth. 
24	
25	Program Summary
26	
27	The BRS A&E program is a voluntary program for male and female youth, ages 13-17, who require a staff secured, out of 
28	home placement for assessment/evaluation, stabilization and transition planning. Youth may be enrolled for up to 90 days 
29	based on individual needs. Capacity for the program is 16 youth. Participants receive a comprehensive assessment 
30	administered by a licensed mental health professional using the evidence-based Global Appraisal of Individual Needs 
31	(GAIN) tool, as well as a service plan that is developed by the Primary Counselor, parent (guardian) and the youth.
32	
33	Each youth in the program has an individualized service plan that reflects how the program will address the youths issues, 
34	describes anticipated outcomes, and is reviewed and approved by the youth and the parent/guardian. Additional 
35	assessments (alcohol and drug, psychiatric medication) may be provided as indicated as well as assist in obtaining 
36	assessments in the community (psychological or psycho sexual). The core philosophy of the program is to provide holistic, 
37	trauma-informed, client- and family-focused services for young people and their families, engaging youth in an array of 
38	services with consideration given to their developmental levels, gender needs, cultural background, community support, 
39	parental involvement, and other social support. The program follows best practices for trauma-informed care and has 
40	adopted a model which emphasizes strength-based and cognitive-behavioral interventions. Services also include individual 
41	and group counseling in a culturally responsive environment, skill training, family counseling and parent training.

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	Assessment and Treatment for Youth and Families (ATYF) is a unique public safety program serving medium and high risk 
18	probation youth with substance abuse, mental health and/or behavioral problems who cannot be effectively treated in 
19	community-based programs because of severe delinquency. 
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	ATYF Mental Health Consultants (MHCs) administer an evidence-based clinical assessment, the Global Appraisal of 
24	Individual Needs (GAIN) which provides a comprehensive analysis of the youth's risks and needs as well as a level of care 
25	determination. ATYF Mental Health Consultants conduct clinical assessments to youth in Multnomah Countys Assessment 
26	and Evaluation Program (A&E) and youth on probation providing clinical recommendations to help courts and probation 
27	staff with dispositional planning. This increases the likelihood that youth will receive appropriate treatment without 
28	compromising community safety. 
29	
30	ATYF MHCs provide outpatient individual and family treatment in strict adherence to an evidence-based model, 
31	Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT). MDFT addresses adolescent substance use and behavioral problems as the 
32	complex issues that they are. It is strength-based, solution-focused, and incorporates a team approach into the treatment of 
33	adolescents. Services are provided in the youths home, the clinic office, school and other community settings and focus on 
34	improving attachments between youth and caregivers, changing anti-social behaviors and reducing drug and alcohol use.
35	
36	Research shows that youth with untreated substance abuse issues are nearly ten times more likely to become chronic re-
37	offenders. Delinquent youth who receive substance abuse treatment have fewer re-arrests, convictions and detention visits 
38	(Cuellar, Markowitz and Libby 2004). ATYF keeps at-risk youth from re-offending and penetrating deeper into the justice 
39	system by linking them to treatment services that change their delinquent thinking and behaviors.

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	Community Healing Initiative provides culturally specific services to medium and high risk African American and Latino 
19	youth and their families through the Community Healing Initiative (CHI). CHI is a family and community-centered 
20	collaboration designed to stop youth and gang violence in Multnomah County by addressing its root causes. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	This collaborative paradigm between the Department of Community Justice (DCJ), and community-based providers is a 
25	joint system responsibility that entails shared financial resources and investments, shared system outcomes and shared 
26	risk. CHI applies supervision/suppression, intervention, and prevention strategies to youth and families who have recent 
27	involvement with high-risk activities and behaviors relevant to violence/gun violence. Within CHI, each family receives a 
28	comprehensive assessment and individualized family service plan. Services are tailored to meet a family's individual needs 
29	and integrated in a manner that reduces and prevents gang violence. The majority of youth served by CHI are on probation 
30	to the Juvenile Court.
31	
32	A network of public safety and social service agencies, and community-based organizations known as the Youth, Family 
33	and Community Team build service capacity, promote integrated case management, increase connection to ethnic 
34	communities in the metropolitan area, and augment community safety. The team focuses on sustainability through fostering 
35	family and community ownership and empowerment. Team services are evidence-based, culturally specific and family 
36	oriented. The family service plans address criminogenic needs that most closely link with recidivism and youth violence. In 
37	addition, CHI youth receive culturally specific mentoring services from mentors with lived experience. 
38	
39	The goals of CHI are to prevent high-risk youth of color from committing new crimes and penetrating further into the justice 
40	system. Culturally competent, strength-based programs that are delivered in homes, schools and the community are shown 
41	to be most effective with disenfranchised youth. All the work conducted through CHI prevents unnecessary and expensive 
42	detainment in correctional facilities.

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	In our community, there is a significant need to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the juvenile justice system and to 
19	focus on and apply early intervention services. The Community Healing Initiative (CHI) Early Intervention and Diversion 
20	Program is a community based and family-focused effort designed to prevent and reduce delinquency, address root causes 
21	and augment community safety and connection. Culturally specific nonprofits provide services, supports and referrals 
22	calibrated to the level of risk and family needs for youth who have committed lower level offenses for the first time.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	CHI is an emerging and innovative overarching best practice for preventing and reducing juvenile justice involvement and 
27	addressing racial and ethnic disparities. At the community level, CHI is essential to building capacity and safety in 
28	communities of color. All qualified youth are referred to community-based providers that offer care coordination, pro-social 
29	programming and referrals to needed services. Risk and needs are assessed through validated tools and the program uses 
30	assertive engagement to focus on those youth with the highest needs. Program coordinators are assigned to a caseload of 
31	youth to develop service plans tailored to meet the individual youth and family situation. School connection/re-connection 
32	assistance, counseling, youth development activities (e.g. sports, arts) and parent support/parenting classes are among the 
33	most critical areas of need. Previously, these youth would have received a warning letter from the Juvenile Services Division 
34	(JSD) after contact with law enforcement. 
35	
36	Also included in this program offer is funding for a part-time FTE to coordinate the implementation of Multnomah Countys 
37	Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) Comprehensive Gang Model Implementation Plan. This 
38	position provides leadership, planning, coordination and implementation of programs; serve as a liaison between County 
39	and community partners; and develop training materials, resources and policies related to youth and gang violence for 
40	various stakeholders. Lastly, also included is funding to provide gang prevention services to culturally specific organizations. 
41	Allocation of funding will be targeted to gang impacted youth and their families and fund services that are aligned with the 
42	Multnomah County Strategic Plan to address Gang violence based on the OJJDP Comprehensive Gang Model 
43	Implementation Plan.
44	
45	Youth of color experience exclusionary school discipline, disconnection from school and a lack of educational attainment at 
46	disproportionate rates in Multnomah County. These factors, along with trauma have been cited as contributors to behavioral 
47	health challenges, delinquency and gang involvement in our community.

24	Program Summary
25	
26	The Animal Services Field Services program delivers comprehensive, 24-hour animal control services with the primary 
27	function of providing public safety to all cities and unincorporated areas in Multnomah County. Such services include, but 
28	are not limited to, responding to dangerous dog attacks, investigating reports of animal bites, quarantining animals due to 
29	suspected rabies exposure, picking up stray animals and assisting law enforcement agencies as first responders for animal 
30	related situations (house fires, arrests, vehicle accidents, etc.). This program is also responsible for ensuring the welfare of 
31	the animals in our county by responding to and investigating all cases involving suspected animal 
32	abuse/neglect/abandonment, investigating reports of dog fighting activities and ensuring that humane standards of care are 
33	provided to all animals in licensed animal facilities (boarding facilities, breeding kennels, retail stores, rescue entities, etc.). 
34	Additionally, Field Services responds to calls regarding deceased animals in public areas, animal nuisance complaints

42	county-wide and directly benefit all persons in Multnomah County. Due to the high number of low-income and homeless 
43	persons in the county, a large percentage of time is dedicated to assisting these populations. Such services often include, 
44	but are not limited to, responding to dog bites within homeless camps, emergency veterinary needs, stray dog issues due to 
45	limited secure enclosures or leash compliance and emergency boarding needs due to incarceration, eviction or owner 
46	medical/mental health crises. As such, the Field Services program provides extremely important service to many

34	charged with carrying out these duties.
35	
36	This program offer is submitted as a request to restore the eliminated ACO-2 position to the Field Services program. The 
37	current staffing pattern for the program consists of 8.00 FTE ACO-2 positions covering five districts, seven days per week. 
38	In order to provide the greatest amount of coverage each day, these positions are scheduled for 10-hour shifts for 4 work 
39	days per week, with contracted services providing emergency-only coverage during the evening/night time hours. There are 
40	only four (4) ACO-2 positions working any given day to cover the entire county. As such, a reduction of 1.00 FTE for this 
41	work unit is a 12.5% reduction in the workforce but equates to a 25% reduction in service capacity. This reduction will limit 
42	resources to meet the needs of the community. Specific impacts may include the following: 1)  Response times may be 
43	longer than desired due to limited number of officers available to respond, resulting in delayed response to public safety 
44	issues such as loose aggressive dogs, animals in distress, dog bite investigations, animals in traffic, cruelty investigations 
45	and welfare checks; 2) Officers' ability to respond to and assist law enforcement agencies in a timely manner may be 
46	reduced; 3) Officers' workloads may increase, especially during the peak season, resulting in greater use of overtime; and 
47	4) The program will have greater difficulty meeting daily demands when officers are on vacation/sick, leaving the team even 
48	more shorthanded in the field.

15	Executive Summary
16	The County Surveyors Office provides maintenance and restoration of public land survey corners, reviews and files surveys 
17	and land division plats, provides survey records to the public, and provides survey support to other County programs and 
18	local agencies.
19	
20	Program Summary
21	The County Surveyors Office provides several services, some of which are mandated by state law.  
22	
23	Mandated functions (required by state statute) include:
24	- Maintenance and restoration of public land survey corner monuments under the Public Land Survey System. The 
25	maintenance and restoration of these corners are critical in ensuring the integrity of property boundaries within the county 
26	because all property descriptions within the state are either directly or indirectly tied to public land survey corners. 
27	- Review, filing and indexing of survey records. All surveys that set permanent monuments (property corners, etc.) within 
28	Multnomah County are required to be filed with our office. State statutes require that we review these surveys and file and 
29	index them in the County Survey Records.
30	- Review and approval of land division plats (subdivisions, partitions, and condominiums). Comprehensive reviews of all 
31	land division plats within the entire county are performed by our office to ensure accuracy and compliance with state 
32	statutes and local ordinances.
33	- Provide access to the public survey records. We maintain a robust online records retrieval system that is widely used by 
34	the public and is essential for providing information required by land surveyors, developers, the title industry, planning 
35	jurisdictions and others.
36	
37	Other functions include:
38	- Provide surveying support for capital improvement projects on county roads and bridges. Current projects include the 
39	Sellwood Bridge Replacement Project and NE Arata Road and NE 238th/242nd Drive Improvement Projects.
40	- Provide surveying support for county departments and local agencies. The program provides ongoing support to Road and 
41	Bridge Engineering and Road Mantenance for various projects (other than CIP). 
42	- Provide surveying expertise to the public, county, and local agencies.

18	Road Services serves a fundamental community need by ensuring that the county-maintained road system is preserved for 
19	the benefit of the public by constructing, operating, repairing and maintaining roadways in a professional and cost-effective 
20	manner. Community members use roads in order to access emergency services, places of employment, businesses, 
21	schools and recreational activities. Multnomah Countys economy is dependent on the transportation system to move 
22	products to markets. Principles of equity are applied during project prioritization, public outreach and project delivery. 
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Road Services is responsible for planning, funding, designing, constructing, maintaining, operating and preserving county-
27	owned roads. The program contributes to the goals and strategies of the Department of Community Services in providing 
28	transportation services county residents rely upon. Road Services focuses on providing quality roads through innovation, a 
29	skilled and diverse workforce and efficient practices. This program offer supports four areas (Roadway Engineering, 
30	Planning and Development, Water Quality and Road Maintenance) to deliver services that comply with local, state and 
31	federal transportation requirements while striving to achieve the transportation priorities of Multnomah County residents 
32	communicated through our public outreach efforts. 
33	
34	The Transportation Division is a regional leader in sustainable maintenance policies and practices that respond to the 
35	Endangered Species Act, Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act. The group fulfills its mandates through cooperative 
36	planning with local and regional jurisdictions, preserving and improving the transportation system through the building of 
37	roads and providing on-going maintenance and traffic services that contribute to public safety, environmental protection and 
38	livability. The group also provides technical and policy expertise on transportation equity, active transportation and 
39	greenhouse gas reduction and supports efforts with the Health Department and Office of Sustainability to accomplish 
40	multiple program objectives, including the Climate Action Plan (CAP).
41	
42	The funding for transportation infrastructure continues to be an acute challenge at the national, state and local levels. 
43	Increasing costs combined with flat revenues have shown that the current funding models are not sustainable. State and 
44	local land use goals promote density, which supports alternative modes of transit to the public (such as buses, bikes and 
45	rail) and have reduced the demand for gasoline consumption, consequently reducing fuel tax receipts. Further, the countys 
46	3-cent fuel tax rate remains static (unchanged since 1981). The Division is directly engaged in regional, state and federal 
47	decision-making on transportation funding that affects the countys ability to achieve many of its interdepartmental goals as 
48	well as capital improvements.

16	Executive Summary
17	The Levee Ready Columbia program supports work to secure the Columbia River levees accreditation, reduce the risk of 
18	catastrophic flooding and protect the health and resiliency of county communities and the broader region. The FY 2020 
19	budget includes a cash contribution to fund the program administration of the Levee Ready Columbia partnership to ensure 
20	that the region addresses federal requirements for levee accreditation. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	As a regional partner in Levee Ready Columbia, the county has supported the work necessary to ensure improvements are 
25	identified and addressed within four drainage districts along the Columbia River levee system in Multnomah County. Failure 
26	to address identified deficiencies puts communities at risk of flooding and poses a risk of loss of levee accreditation under 
27	the Federal Emergency Management Agencys (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program as well as noncompliance with 
28	the US Army Corps of Engineers Rehabilitation and Inspection Program. 
29	
30	The project is a multi-year effort entering its fifth year. The past four years focused on conducting evaluations of the levee 
31	systems and studying options for long-term governance solutions. Future work will include developing levee improvement 
32	project alternatives, implementation of improvements, creation of a long-term governance structure and completion of 
33	certification and accreditation processes. This work will be supported by Levee Ready Columbia program staff funded 
34	through partnership financial contributions.
35	
36	In addition to providing financial support to Levee Ready Columbia, the county will continue to act as the fiscal agent in 
37	administering state grants and loans secured in 2016 for the regional partnership. The county will also continue to provide 
38	representation in partnership meetings.

19	The Bridge Services program operates and preserves the county's long-term investment in its six Willamette River bridges. 
20	The program also offers technical and maintenance support to the Roads Services program for 24 other bridge structures. 
21	The Willamette River crossings consist of four movable bridges (Hawthorne, Morrison, Burnside and Broadway) and two 
22	fixed structures (Sellwood and Sauvie Island). Bridge Services includes Engineering, Maintenance and Operations.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Engineering provides planning, engineering and construction project management for the preservation of structural, 
27	mechanical, electrical and corrosion protection (paint) systems of the county's bridges. Most design and construction work 
28	is performed by contractors with direction and oversight by Engineering. Projects are identified, prioritized and ranked in the 
29	Transportation Capital Improvement Plan (TCIP) using a variety of criteria, including equity. TCIP ranking and available 
30	funds from the Bridge Services program or grants determine the projects chosen for design and construction. Engineering 
31	also works with other agencies to secure funding from state and federal sources. Engineering is typically engaged in 
32	multiple capital improvement projects at various stages of development/construction. Construction was completed on the 
33	Broadway Rall Wheel Replacement project in FY19. The Burnside Maintenance project is anticipated to be completed in 
34	FY20. The Earthquake Ready Burnside Bridge Feasibility Study was completed in FY19, resulting in four options that will be 
35	studied in-depth during the environmental review phase that will continue through FY20. This project incorporates equity 
36	principles by considering impacts to underserved populations and ensuring representation of these communities on our 
37	advisory committees.    
38	 
39	Maintenance staff perform preventative maintenance and smaller scale upgrades/enhancements on the bridges. They 
40	ensure the operational reliability of mechanical, electrical, structural and corrosion protection (paint) systems. Maintenance 
41	places priority on response to emergencies, performance of specialized preventative maintenance tasks and making 
42	repairs/enhancements as needed. Some of the tasks include bridge repairs resulting from vehicle accidents, mechanical 
43	and electrical repairs/replacements, electrical and mechanical systems troubleshooting, minor roadway or sidewalk repairs, 
44	graffiti removal and snow removal.
45	 
46	Operations raises and lowers bridge draw spans to allow passage of ships and other river traffic and performs some 
47	preventative maintenance tasks. Spanish and Russian language bridge lift announcements were added on the Hawthorne 
48	Bridge in FY19. Both Maintenance and Operations work closely with Engineering on a wide variety of projects and issues.

19	The Transportation Capital program represents the county and other fund sources that pass through the county to make 
20	capital improvements on county-owned bridges (Sellwood, Hawthorne, Morrison, Burnside, Broadway and Sauvie Island), 
21	roads, bicycle/pedestrian facilities and culverts.The purpose of this program is to maintain and enhance the existing 
22	transportation system by identifying needs, prioritizing projects and securing funding to construct projects. 
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	This program represents the county and other fund sources to make capital improvements on county-owned bridges, roads, 
27	bicycle/pedestrian facilities and culverts. Capital improvements are relatively high dollar projects to rehabilitate, improve or 
28	replace transportation infrastructure assets. Current capital needs are identified in the Transportation Capital Improvement 
29	Plan (TCIP), which outlines needed road and bridge improvements for the next 20 years. Projects are identified, prioritized 
30	and ranked in the TCIP using a variety of criteria that includes equity, sustainability, safety, asset management, mobility and 
31	resiliency. The Transportation Capital program prioritizes and schedules projects to match available funds and new funds 
32	projected for a 5-year period. 
33	
34	The countys transportation infrastructure assets are valued in excess of $1.8 billion, thus we deem it very important to 
35	protect these assets. Many factors contribute to the constant degradation of the transportation infrastructure which requires 
36	continual maintenance. The major bridge transportation capital projects included are the Burnside Bridge Maintenance and 
37	the Morrison Bridge Paint projects. Roadway projects in East County include bike and pedestrian improvements to Arata 
38	Road, Stark Street and NE 238th Ave. West County projects include safety improvements on Cornelius Pass Road. Also 
39	included are fish passage and culvert projects on Beaver Creek at Cochran Road. 
40	
41	The Earthquake Ready Burnside Bridge Project is a long-term project to create a seismically resilient crossing of the 
42	Willamette River in downtown Portland. This project will enable emergency services to respond, allow families to reconnect, 
43	and support economic recovery after a major earthquake. The Earthquake Ready Burnside Feasibility Phase is complete, 
44	resulting in four alternatives that will be studied in-depth during the environmental review phase that will continue through 
45	FY20.  
46	
47	This program relies upon the Bridge Engineering and Roadway Engineering programs to provide county labor and to plan 
48	and oversee the design and construction associated with capital projects.

16	Executive Summary
17	This program will result in project development of tier one projects identified through the countys American with Disabilities 
18	Act Transition Plan. Tier one projects are top priority projects identified from the countys inventory of curb ramps. 
19	Prioritizing factors include location, equity, usability and condition. Tier one projects would begin to be addressed through 
20	this program offer.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, prohibits discrimination and promotes equal opportunity for 
25	people with disabilities in accessing employment, government services, public accommodations and public transportation.  
26	
27	Curb ramps are one of the most vital public service facilities on our roadways. Although everyone uses curb ramps to safely 
28	cross streets and access sidewalks, those with mobility impairments depend on them the most. Multnomah County has 
29	adopted ADA compliant design standards. This project ensures that the county meets the ADA standards by reconstructing 
30	non-compliant ramps. Over 90% of ramps in the countys right-of-way system require modification. Tier one includes 163 
31	high priority ramps (of 950) that need to be upgraded. The inventory consists of a total of six tiers.
32	
33	In 2016, the county completed an inventory of physical mobility barriers within the countys right-of-way in compliance with 
34	Title II of the ADA, ODOT Policy PER 01-05, Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 447 and the Public Right-of-Way 
35	Accessibility Guide (PROWAG) revision 2013. Each curb ramp location has been evaluated and priority has been given to 
36	ramps with the highest score based on factors that include location, usability and condition. Additionally, these factors 
37	considered equity by including demographics and access to services in prioritizing projects in communities that have been 
38	historically underserved. Multnomah County developed the scoring criteria to analyze the accessibility and usability of curb 
39	ramps on the countys road network for persons who use mobility devices such as wheelchairs and crutches.
40	
41	This project will start project development of the tier one priority ramps, moving them closer to construction.

19	Land Use Planning guides thoughtful development while preserving and protecting open spaces, natural resources, scenic 
20	views, wildlife, forests and farmlands through implementation of the countys zoning code and comprehensive plan. The 
21	program provides current and long-range planning as well as code compliance for the rural areas of Multnomah County. 
22	The planning program plays an important and active role at the state and regional level to ensure adopted codes, plans and 
23	policies comply with state requirements while ensuring preservation and protection of the countys rural character.
24	
25	Program Summary
26	
27	Unincorporated Multnomah County is a unique and highly sought after location to live, work and recreate because it offers 
28	open spaces, natural and scenic resources, forests and farmland in close proximity to the state's largest city. Land Use 
29	Planning develops and implements codes and policies to preserve the rural character by preventing urban sprawl.
30	
31	The focus of the Long-Range Planning program is to create, revise and adopt plans, policies, and zoning codes in a 
32	uniform, fair and equitable manner to ensure that development is consistent with the rural character of the county. At the 
33	end of 2016, the county adopted the revised Comprehensive Plan and staff are currently consolidating the Zoning Code. 
34	Long-Range Planning staff will continue to focus on drafting code to implement the community's vision articulated within the 
35	revised plan. Planning staff also play a key role in coordinating with regional partners, such as Metro and the Columbia 
36	River Gorge Commission, to ensure the countys vision and values continue to be achieved. Further, planning staff help the 
37	county achieve goals for rural areas by addressing policies and plans within the Urban Growth Boundary.
38	
39	The Current Planning program provides assistance to property owners, neighbors, developers, realtors and other agencies 
40	with the land use process to objectively, consistently and fairly apply the countys development standards and procedures. 
41	Staff explain land use rules, review land use and building applications for compliance with applicable laws and problem 
42	solves complex land use issues with applicants and community members. 
43	
44	The Code Compliance program responds to possible land use complaints on a voluntary compliance basis. The focus of 
45	this program is education and compliance to successfully resolve existing and potential issues. This is accomplished by 
46	encouraging property owners to voluntarily resolve land use conflicts without the use of penalties or fines whenever 
47	possible. Planning also manages a Solid Waste and Recycling Management program, which provides outreach materials 
48	and licenses service providers in the unincorporated areas of the county for solid waste and recyclable materials.

16	In 1984, Multnomah County entered into intergovernmental revenue sharing agreements with the cities of Portland, 
17	Gresham, Troutdale and Fairview, whereby dedicated county road funds receipts are transferred as county roads are 
18	annexed. The supplemental payments executed by this program offer fulfill the funding requirements of these agreements 
19	as it pertains to county road funds. 
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	These agreements require the county to transfer prescribed revenue amounts it receives from the county gas tax and state 
24	highway funding. County road funds are transferred to the cities, where they are commingled into the cities' transportation 
25	operating budgets. The cities are not required to report how county funds are used. The cities' allowed uses of these funds 
26	are defined under ORS 366, which requires funds only be used for the construction, reconstruction, improvement, repair, 
27	maintenance, operation and use of public highways, roads, streets and the administration thereof.
28	
29	For Troutdale and Fairview, the supplemental payment formula is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index  
30	Urban Index for the Portland metropolitan area. For Portland and Gresham, the supplemental payment formula is adjusted 
31	based on actual receipts collected by the county. 
32	
33	Planned FY20 Payments:
34	- City of Fairview    $14,430
35	- City of Troutdale  $17,800
36	- City of Gresham  $4,691,647
37	- City of Portland   $38,305,000
38	
39	Between 1984 and 2019 the county has transferred 607 miles of roads to the cities.      
40	
41	This program offer does not deliver any county services and is submitted for the provision of a supplemental payment to the 
42	cities. The agreements remain subject to future appropriations by any future Board of County Commissioners or City 
43	Councils. The formulas in these agreements were intended to remain permanent unless amended by mutual agreement.

29	residential use such as a homeless shelter but are needed to meet the current homelessness/housing emergency. Building 
30	systems are often strained. The coordination of keeping these kinds of facilities operational until permanent shelters can be 
31	brought on line, and a move made, is both critical and time-consuming. This position will support Facilities' coordination 
32	efforts for this ongoing work, as well as the operations of the Mead Shelter, Willamette Shelter and the Gresham Women's 
33	Shelter.
34	
35	JOHS is working with Facilities to help identify and establish new shelters within the community in the coming years. This

18	The Capital Improvement Program actively monitors, upgrades, and improves the County's portfolio of Tier II and III 
19	buildings. The program preserves the County's assets by investing in improvements that maintain building values and 
20	provide accessible, functional, and energy efficient facilities for the operating programs that use them.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Capital Improvement Program (CIP) provides funding for the annual 5-year Capital Plan that focuses on the County's 
25	18 primary owned Tier II and III buildings. A Tier II building is one that is a desirable part of the County's long-term portfolio 
26	but has significant deferred maintenance needs which must be addressed. A Tier III building is one that is not economical or 
27	is impractical to bring to County standards and is therefore designated for disposition. Capital expenditures are avoided or 
28	minimized in Tier III facilities pending disposition of the building, if possible. The plan works in conjunction with the Facilities 
29	Strategic Plan which provides a basis for a sound investment strategy that addresses building needs and includes projects 
30	ranging from equipment upgrades to construction of new facilities over a 10 year horizon.  
31	
32	The program allows Capital fees, bond/levy, grants, and other funding components to be distributed based on priorities 
33	established with the aid of a detailed needs assessment and a decision-scoring matrix. The program looks for project 
34	efficiencies that benefit the building users and extend the useful life of the building.
35	
36	The 5-year CIP Plan sets clear goals and fosters communication with departments as well as providing a tool to facilitate 
37	collaboration with both internal and external clients and building users. The program uses a PULSE (Planned Useful Life - 
38	System Evaluation) database to track building system life cycles.
39	
40	Implementation of the Facilities Asset Strategic Plan (FASP) will also impact future capital needs. Efforts are underway 
41	County-wide to work on our building portfolio's recapitalization needs, which the current 8% annual CIP revenue increases 
42	are not adequate to address.

18	The Asset Preservation (AP) Program is designed to create a self-sustaining fund which provides for the continuing 
19	reinvestment and capital work required to keep the County's Tier I buildings safe, reliable, functional and efficient for the 
20	operating programs that use them.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Asset Preservation Program (AP) provides funding for the annual 5-year Capital Plan that focuses on the County's 35 
25	primary owned Tier I buildings. A Tier I building is one which is designated for long-term retention and which meets current 
26	County standards. AP funding is intended to support replacement or repairs to essential building elements such as roofs, 
27	plumbing, electrical, heating ventilation air-conditioning (HVAC), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) modifications, 
28	seismic upgrades, and interior finishes that keep buildings functioning and optimizing their potential. The program prolongs 
29	building life and provides the County with assets that are worth their market value. It includes planned upgrades in 
30	equipment and systems intended to meet changing building needs.
31	
32	The AP program continues to look at the long term County benefits by examining program needs, building needs, flexibility, 
33	cost efficiencies, building operations and maintenance. The AP Program is managed via the annual 5-year Capital Plans 
34	that focus on short-term requirements that are integrated with the long-term Facilities Asset Strategic Plan (FASP). The 
35	Capital Plan is based on a comprehensive database which identifies all projected replacement needs in Tier I buildings over 
36	three decades and then prioritizes and schedules needed work in the future. This allows Asset Preservation funds, 
37	bond/levy proceeds, grants,etc. to be invested based on priority, and optimizes return on investment.

18	This program accounts for the energy and utility costs incurred in County facilities including electric, natural gas, water, 
19	sewer and waste/recycling for County owned buildings. Expenses are passed through to County Departments as a building 
20	specific utility charge based on occupancy. The Facilities Director's Office monitors, evaluates, and approves payment, as 
21	well as recommends strategy for building utility expenses in an ongoing effort to increase operating efficiencies and reduce 
22	the financial impact on critical County programs and services.  
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Facilities and Property Management (FPM) is continuously evaluating energy and utility consumption across the County in 
27	order to identify anomalies, maximize saving energy opportunities and minimize the County's utility expenses. Utility 
28	expenses are a pass through charge to the building tenants that either occupy owned or leased space in facilities used for 
29	County operations.  
30	
31	Electric utilities constitute about half of the utility expenses followed by water/sewer, natural gas and waste/refuse. Facilities 
32	continues to work with the Office of Sustainability to educate building occupants on the value of resource conservation. The 
33	Energy-Utility Specialist in the Director's Office works with industry partners including the Energy Trust of Oregon, Oregon 
34	Department of Energy and the City of Portland to address operating efficiency and capture incentives for energy savings 
35	measures.  
36	
37	Utility rates fluctuate from year to year based on the availability of energy sources. These rates increase similar to the cost 
38	of inflation over time, but can vary based on economic factors. FPM implements energy and water efficiency projects in 
39	collaboration with building occupants to reduce consumption and achieve Climate Action Plan goals. In FY 2018, the Board 
40	of County Commissioners resolved to purchase 100% of electricity through renewable energy sources, consequently the FY 
41	2020 utility rates continues to include the cost of purchasing renewable energy credits.

18	The Lease Management team supplements the County's owned real estate portfolio with leased space to ensure 
19	departments can deliver programs and services effectively and efficiently to their clients. In addition, lease management is 
20	responsible for leasing excess County building space to external clients to reduce vacancy impacts on County operations. 
21	These revenue leases supplement operations and help offset maintenance expenses. The priority is to lease to outside 
22	entities that complement existing County programs and services.   
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The Lease Management program is responsible for approximately 500,000 square feet, or 15%, of the County's portfolio. 
27	Lease Management works directly with departments to identify their space needs based upon existing and future program 
28	requirements, logistics, operating efficiencies, adjacency opportunities and schedules. Working strategically with 
29	Departments to assess future space needs, the staff identifies potential County owned space and leasing options. The team 
30	evaluates lease requirements and space needs three to five years in advance to effectively position the Departments' needs 
31	and the overall County portfolio.
32	
33	In addition, working with the Departments in assessing options, Lease Management negotiates lease terms, obtains 
34	pertinent public permits, manages landlord disputes and proactively coordinates lease renewals. The program also provides 
35	operational support including Board approvals, lease representation, documentation, administration, legal coordination and 
36	enforcement. Team members manage leases to the highest professional standards to ensure full compliance and protection 
37	of the County's interest. 
38	
39	To reduce vacancy rates and generate revenues that reduce overall rates, Lease Management also works with 
40	Departments to evaluate existing and potential vacant space to maximize space utilization. Excess space may be leased to 
41	external programs including community service organizations, government agencies and private entities.

18	This program offer is for the development and execution of the strategy to relocate the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office 
19	(MCSO) Law Enforcement Division to an efficient, economical and sustainable facility appropriately sized and sited to 
20	deliver critical public safety services to the citizens of Multnomah County.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	The Sheriffs Office moved to the Hansen Building complex, corner of NE Glisan and NE 122ND Avenue in 1976. The 
24	Hansen Building was built in 1956 as a County health clinic. Due to the buildings infrastructural needs, seismic liability, 
25	inefficient layout, security challenges and the distance to the Sheriffs current service districts, it no longer meets the 
26	operational requirements of a modern law enforcement agency. In FY 2017, the majority of the Sheriff's Office staff moved 
27	to the the Penumbra Kelly Building at 4747 E Burnside in Portland. (The Hansen Building is now used as a temporary 
28	shelter). 
29	
30	In FY 2015,  Phase 1 of the project including the Project Plan and Programming was completed along with conceptual 
31	budget estimate to the Board followed as well as a request for approval for Phase 2 Project Delivery and Development Plan 
32	according to the FAC 1 Administrative Procedure.  In FY 2017, a 3.54 acre parcel of land adjacent to the Troutdale Police 
33	Command Center was acquired by the County as a potential relocation site. Given changes in the local public safety 
34	environment, including the election of a new Multnomah County Sheriff in FY 2017, and policing discussions with other local 
35	cities, we continue to explore opportunities to meet the needs of Sheriff's Office. The ownership of Troutdale property does 
36	not align with the new Strategic Plans from the Sheriff's Office.  Disposition options are being considered for the Troutdale 
37	parcel.  MCSO Business Case continues to be developed and refined for Approval by the Chair in FY 2019.  A number of 
38	potential sites for consolidation continue to be considered.

18	The Department of Community Justice (DCJ) and the Facilities and Property Management Division (FPM) identified the 
19	need to acquire an asset in a mid-County location to consolidate four separate sites. In FY 2017, the County purchased a 
20	three building office development property with approximately 36,000 rental square feet located on a 2.46 acre site at 1245-
21	1415 SE 122nd Ave in Portland.  DCJ will occupy just the North and West buildings of the Campus.  The South Building will 
22	be available for other Program use.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	This program envisions the co-location of DCJ District Managers, Parole and Probation units, space for Teaming Partners, a 
27	client Resource Center, a Training Facility for Parole Officers, a Community Services support facility and convenient staff 
28	amenities including break areas, respite room, fitness room and showers.  This will increase operational efficiency, align 
29	departmental points of service with their client base and eliminate the lease risks associated with the existing leased 
30	facilities.
31	
32	Goals for this new Mid-County facility include:
33	
34	 Creating a campus environment that serves clients in a centrally located and easily accessible area
35	 Providing a community resource center
36	 Providing a safe and secure facility for staff, clients and neighbors
37	 Achieving cost efficiency by co-locating services
38	 Increasing efficiency of work areas in terms of hoteling and space utilization
39	 Supporting public transit and providing convenient transit connections for staff and clients
40	
41	In FY 2019, FPM completed design and construction documents to renovate the existing buildings. Staff will be relocated 
42	into Modular Offices on the Hansen site during construction. Construction is planned to begin Spring 2019 and span 12 to 
43	18 months.

17	The Multnomah County Justice Center, located in downtown Portland, is a 16-story building with 2 sublevels, of which 9 
18	floors are operated as a detention center. The security electronics were overhauled in 2006, when new Programmable Logic 
19	Controllers and touch panels were installed, along with a new fire alarm system and a small video system upgrade. Since 
20	then, due to changes in technology the analog intercom and video systems are becoming difficult to support. New 
21	technologies available will lower cost while improving the operation, maintainability, and safety of the facility.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	This carryover project is currently in progress. Bids closed in mid-January, 2019. Once awarded, coordination of scheduled 
26	work will need to be arranged between Contractor and MCSO before final schedule is determined.  Under this project, the 
27	intercom and video surveillance systems will be upgraded to newer technologies, utilizing the same equipment and brands 
28	that were recently installed in the other County detention facilities (Inverness and the Juvenile Center), and have become 
29	the standard for the County.  This project will identify areas with inadequate video coverage, add new cameras and 
30	technologies as necessary to ensure compliance with the current PREA Standards.  Additionally, this will extend the lifetime 
31	of the security electronics for another 15-20 years, with appropriate maintenance and software upgrades. 
32	
33	This project will replace 5 different systems: 
34	1 - INTERCOM SYSTEM: The intercom system provides inter communications between the various control centers to their 
35	associated inmate cells, movement doors, and other locations where immediate, highly intelligible 2-way audio is needed. 
36	2- VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM: The video surveillance system provides visual supervision and 60 minutes of 
37	recording time for inmate and public areas of the facility, and provides for automated call-up of associated images whenever 
38	door control or intercom communications functions are in use.
39	3 - PLC/TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEMS: The current PLCs, which are the brains of the system, are Modicon Quantum series 
40	by Schneider Electric, and are in good condition, although the CPUs do not support the current Unity programming 
41	software.
42	4 - ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM: The access control system allows the staff to enter doors and areas without control room 
43	intervention, using card or token readers at each door or elevator, and is also used for interlock override by the control room 
44	staff. 
45	5 - ADMINISTRATIVE INTERCOM PHONE SYSTEM: The facility has an administrative intercom phone system, consisting 
46	of a network of dedicated detention-grade master phone stations that allow for fast and easy inter communications between 
47	control room officers, management, medical, and other detention-oriented locations.
48	The order of the system implementation will be planned based on risk and inter-dependencies.  The FAC-1 process will be 
49	followed with periodic Board check ins.

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	This program offer will fund essential repairs to the Multnomah County Sheriff Office (MCSO) River Patrol boathouses and 
18	related facilities. These repairs will address immediate life safety, code and seismic deficiencies, roof-related upgrades, and 
19	repairs that require immediate attention to prevent further degradation of the structure. In FY 2019, MCSO will restart 
20	contributions to the Capital Improvement Fund (CIP) for future capital needs.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	A study was recently commissioned by Facility and Property Management (FPM) and completed in February, 2018 to 
25	determine the scope of deferred maintenance required for the MCSO River Patrol boathouses, docks, and ramps, eight 
26	structures in total. Deferred maintenance in the amount of ~$2 million was identified by the contracted 
27	architecture/engineering firm. Of the ~$2 million, $1,036,728, is considered to be essential to address immediate life safety, 
28	code and seismic deficiencies, roof-related upgrades, and repairs that require immediate attention to prevent further 
29	degradation of the structures. We currently have an imminent danger correction notice for all Columbia River Patrol 
30	boathouses from an electrical inspector to prevent Electrical Shock Drowning (ESD). 
31	
32	This program offer is asking for the cost of identified essential work to ensure the safety of County staff and the public, and 
33	to ensure that compliance with code requirements is not delayed. Funding for the remaining work identified in the study will 
34	be evaluated at a later date. Funded work will be managed by the Department of County Assets (DCA) FPM Capital 
35	Improvement team. Structures identified that need improvements include: B496 Willamette River Boathouse; B307 
36	Columbia River Gleason Landing River Patrol, B493 Boathouse 1, B494 Boathouse 2, and B495 Boathouse 3, and the 
37	fueling dock; B309 Columbia River Chinook Landing Boathouse; and the B499 Columbia River Bonneville Boathouse.

17	Inmates in the Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC) often have diagnosed mental health issues, can be 
18	experiencing depression, and are usually at a time of crisis in their lives. The Sheriff's Office has set suicide prevention as a 
19	primary goal and is committed to providing a safe and secure housing environment for all inmates in MCDC by structuring 
20	the buildings, dormitories, and cells to be free of any hazards, including ones developed by inmates. This program offer 
21	improves MCDC by funding the replacement of wall-mounted cell lights and completing the cell window cover project.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	At the Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC), the design of the existing detention light fixtures creates a gap 
26	between the wall and the fixture. This gap can't be filled with epoxy because the entire housing must be removed in order to 
27	replace the bulb.
28	
29	The Facilities & Property Management has identified maximum security replacement fixtures which would eliminate the gap, 
30	thus, reducing the risk of suicide attempts. These new security fixtures are also equipped with LED lamps, providing up to 
31	50,000 hours of useful life, and a significant energy cost savings over the existing bulbs. This program offer would replace 
32	the current wall mounted fixtures in all 448 cells at MCDC.
33	
34	The Multnomah County Detention Center Jail was originally designed with cell window frames that have exposed edges 
35	which are a safety concern for inmates and staff. The frames themselves have edges that sheets can be tied to, and also 
36	there can be cracked and exposed grout by the frame which can be broken out and used for weapons. A project was started 
37	in 2011 to use a protective metal frame covering the exposed existing frame edges in each cell. To date the 4th and 8th 
38	floors have been completed, but floors 5, 6 and 7 still have 75 cells that need to have this suicide risk addressed. This 
39	program offer provides the funding to finish the project.

17	Sharps drop boxes are a community-based disposal strategy which encourages safe disposal of used syringes by people 
18	who use injection drugs and provides the public with a convenient disposal option. In FY19, Multnomah County led a multi-
19	jurisdictional Healthy Streets pilot to expand the number of sharps drop boxes in our community. In April of 2019, 14 new 
20	SDBs were sited across the community, bringing the total number of SDBs to 17. In FY20, the County will continue to 
21	provide support in implementing the expanded pilot and will track its success in reducing waste.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Improper syringe disposal has posed an ongoing waste management challenge for some time, and the national opioid 
26	epidemic has contributed to this growing problem in recent years. Opioid use and dependence across the country has led to 
27	a sustained rise in injection drug use and syringe debris.
28	
29	Community members have become increasingly concerned about syringes found in neighborhoods, public spaces and 
30	businesses. In response, Multnomah County, the City of Portland, TriMet, Downtown Clean & Safe and Metro created the 
31	Healthy Streets pilot program to test the impact of SDBs on reducing syringe waste. The Healthy Streets pilot project is one 
32	component of a strategy to reduce the number of improperly discarded syringes and provide the public a safe community-
33	based disposal option.
34	
35	Sharps disposal boxes create a 24/7 disposal option for safe disposal of syringes by community members finding used 
36	syringes. In partnership with other jurisdictions, the County has developed a website and communication materials to 
37	support the public in taking action when finding syringes. After reviewing existing designs for syringe drop boxes, the 
38	Healthy Streets pilot partners agreed to design and fabricate a unique, more tamper resistant syringe box. The 
39	procurement, design and fabrication of these boxes took longer than expect, and the boxes were installed in April 2019. In 
40	FY20, the County will continue to play a coordination role in maintaining and servicing sharps boxes, tracking the success of 
41	the program and working with other jurisdiction partners. A total of 17 boxes will be operation throughout the county in 
42	FY20. 
43	
44	Health Department will manage the biohazard vendor contract and payments.  Facilities and Property Management will act 
45	as liaison for the Health Department regarding, service calls, installation and repair of boxes.

18	This program is to enhance our Cyber Security posture at Multnomah County.  Over the past 3 years we have worked 
19	diligently to achieve our Cyber Security goals and have been able to significantly increase our cyber posture.  The additional 
20	funds in our Cyber Security 2.0 program offer will allow us to continue our progress to address gaps and deficiencies that 
21	have been identified by both internal and third party reviews. 
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	From ransomware to DDoS attacks, threats have multiplied to the point where we can no longer say perimeter defenses like 
26	firewalls are enough. We need to know when our assets are behaving strangely on the network. There's no faster way to 
27	detect anomalies than real-time analytics with wire data.  Acquiring this capability will enable us to proactively hunt for 
28	threats, analyze and understand user behavior to identify anomalies and identify and address devices that should not be on 
29	our network. This program will address the following: 
30	
31	Second layer authentication: This program will improve information security by adding a second layer of authentication to 
32	select County applications.  This project will initially focus on building the technical and organizational infrastructure for 
33	County employees with elevated privileges to use this service.  This lays the groundwork for required implementation by key 
34	applications and populations in the successive phases.  
35	
36	Network Access Control: With the increase of network activity on our industrial network (doors, security, heating and 
37	cooling, etc) we are at greater risk of experiencing a breach in that environment due to the fact that the environment is 
38	largely not understood or defined.  Network Access Control  can help us to understand what should and should not be on 
39	our network and restrict what these devices are able to access based on rules that we define.
40	
41	Privileged Access and Identity Management: Privileged access is the access most often targeted by cyber security threats 
42	because this access leads to the most valuable and confidential information.  Implementing a Privileged Access and Identity 
43	Management solution will allow us to have better control in managing and securing privileged accounts to meet the needs of 
44	the access control requirement for a number of the compliance regulations.

17	This program provides funding to replace the legislatively mandated CRIMES case management system. The current 
18	system is 15 years old and the underlying technology is outdated and prohibitively expensive to maintain. The IT Division 
19	will continue to work in partnership with the Multnomah County District Attorney (MCDA) to implement a new system and 
20	decommission the old.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The CRIMES case management system has been functioning as an electronic computer application since its creation in 
25	1982. The current iteration consists of two modules (CRIMES Juvenile and CRIMES Adult) and has long surpassed its 
26	expected technical lifespan, with the current modules having provided solid and dependable case tracking and management 
27	to the MCDA's Office since its purchase 15 years ago.  Technology capabilities have advanced considerably and continued 
28	modification of the underlying obsolete technology has become cost prohibitive. Along with increasingly prohibitive licensing 
29	costs, the current system is contributing to delays in the timely pursuit of prosecution of crime and public safety. The 
30	purpose of this funding request is to implement new technology that will modernize the case management system, thereby 
31	ensuring speedy prosecution while reducing operating costs.

18	The County relies on a high speed, broadband fiber network provided by the City of Portland on leased equipment and 
19	infrastructure from Comcast. The agreement supporting that access expires in 2021. The County must determine the path 
20	forward for a new broadband infrastructure solution. The County is seeking a partnership with the City. The funds required 
21	to meet a new infrastructure relationship are under evaluation. This program requests $1.0 million to support the design 
22	phase.  
23	
24	Program Summary
25	Multnomah Countys communication network relies on a mix of connections (I-Net, IRNE and commercial provider services) 
26	to serve all county sites. The Comcast-owned fiber I-Net service, which services a large portion of the sites, will not be 
27	available to the County in its current form after the Comcast franchise agreement expires in 2020. The county 
28	commissioned an independent evaluation of the business case and to obtain recommendations for replacing I-Net. This

20	The Juvenile Detention Program located at the Juvenile Justice Center provides health care services to youth. Currently, the 
21	medical records are paper-based. This is inefficient. In addition, the use of a non-electronic medical record poses potential 
22	challenges for legibility, accuracy, continuity of care and medical-legal issues. This program is to establish requirements to 
23	procure and implement an EMR that meets the unique needs of this care facility.
24	
25	Program Summary
26	
27	The staff at JDH currently use a paper-based medical record system and document medication delivery on paper 
28	medication administration records.  Handwritten prescriptions are used to order medications.  Laboratory and other test 
29	results return and are filed as paper records. This program will document the requirements for an EMR, conduct a 
30	procurement, and implement the selected solution. This program will require significant business process design to 
31	automate paper-based practices. The County currently uses EPIC as its Electronic Medical Record (EMR) within its other 
32	primary care locations. Unfortunately, the module of EPIC is not designed for an in-patient care setting, thus the County 
33	must select an alternate solution.

23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	ISSUE: Multnomah county departments contract with agencies to provide services for residents. Departments are 
27	responsible for monitoring and supporting performance throughout the life of the contract. Departmental capacity and 
28	approaches to monitoring and supporting contractors varies, and contractors have either been found to need, or have 
29	requested assistance with critical organizational capacity.  Of particular interest is how contractors perform with regard to 
30	safety and quality of services.  There is a need to assess and assist contractors to establish consistent best processes, 
31	practices and policies that ensure safety, quality and efficiency.
32	
33	GOALS: Assess the current state processes among the selected contractors related to safety, quality and efficiency. Assess 
34	using data, risk reports, and client satisfaction. Identify improvement opportunities related to contractors processes, 
35	practices, county monitoring expectations, monitoring tools and technical assistance. 
36	
37	ACTIVITIES:  DCHS will secure a limited duration expert in CQI who will work with the pilot participants (contractors). A 
38	contractor selection process for the pilot will be developed. This pilot will assist the contractors with process mapping, root

18	This program offer will fund a Labor Compliance Pilot Program to provide education and support for workers and 
19	construction contractors on wage theft prevention and will create a volunteer program to interview workers on the jobsite to 
20	help ensure they are paid a fair wage. The program offer will also purchase data infrastructure to help the County with 
21	compliance monitoring.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Wage theft exists when a worker is not paid or is underpaid for their work. Wage theft harms workers by driving down 
26	wages, and harms honest contractors by making them less competitive. Wage theft is particularly prevalent in the 
27	construction industry. According to the Oregon Center for Public Policy, Between 2015 and 2016, the most recent period of 
28	data we analyzed, the construction industry had the second highest number of wage claims as a share of its workforce.  
29	Some wage theft is unintentional (for example, a calculation error), and easily correctable when identified. Other wage theft 
30	is intentional, and often harms workers who may not report it for fear of losing their jobs. A County Labor Compliance 
31	Program can support workers and contractors to ensure workers are getting paid correctly. 
32	
33	This Labor Compliance Pilot Program will: 1) provide technical assistance and support to ensure that contractors and 
34	subcontractors properly classify workers and are in compliance with BOLI labor laws which include Apprenticeship rules and 
35	Prevailing Wage laws; 2) ensure that workers on County projects understand their rights related to wage laws, 3) train and 
36	oversee authorized community volunteers to support the Countys verification of certified payroll by interviewing workers at 
37	worksites regarding wages, benefits, and hours, and 4) purchase software to enable robust monitoring and reporting on 
38	wages and benefits paid on County construction projects.

18	The Property & Liability Risk Program (P&LRP) manages the County's property and liability risks in accordance with all 
19	legal requirements and County policies/procedures.  It focuses on countywide risk exposures, liability/subrogation claims, 
20	property claims, purchasing insurance, loss control/prevention, and assists departments in managing identified risks.  
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	Each year, the Property & Liability Risk Program (P&LRP) seeks to determine the County's "Cost of Risk", benchmark 
25	against other entities and continually improve the program by implementing best practices. The (P&LRP) purchases 
26	property insurance, marine coverage, crime coverage, excess liability, excess medical malpractice coverage, bonds, and 
27	other specialized insurance coverage for the County. Where the cost of insurance prohibits purchase or coverage is not 
28	available, we self fund losses. The P&LRP recommends the types/limits of insurance for contracts, recommends the 
29	purchase of specialized insurance and develops countywide policies and procedures related to loss prevention and control. 
30	The P&LRP designs and implements risk management strategies for the prevention of risk exposure and property and 
31	liability loss countywide. The program adjusts property loss claims, and oversees the Third Party Administrator contracted to 
32	process general liability insurance claims for the County. Litigation and large general liability insurance claims are settled 
33	with expertise from the County Attorney's Office. The County chooses to "self-insure" (retain a certain amount of financial 
34	exposure to loss) and purchases property and excess liability coverage for large property and liability related claims. This 
35	decision controls the loss adjustment process, minimizes our "total cost of risk" (uninsured claims costs + insurance costs + 
36	administrative costs), and motivates internal loss control behavior. A department's internal property and liability allocated 
37	charges are based on their past losses using actuarial data and historical loss data to determine cost percentage rates 
38	based on anticipated future losses.

18	Central Human Resources (CHR) services focus on the full lifecycle of employment, developing county-wide resources for 
19	attraction, recruitment, selection and ongoing training and development. CHR services implement strategies to address key 
20	components of the countywide Human Resources Strategic Plan. Resources include talent acquisition, talent development 
21	and classification and compensation, providing systems and tools to attract, train, and retain a diverse, highly qualified 
22	workforce.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Classification and Compensation provides pay and classification structures necessary for the County to offer competitive 
27	pay and appealing career paths. Classification and Compensation provides the pay and job classification frameworks that 
28	facilitate external competitiveness, ensure internal equity, promote employee retention and support career growth. The team 
29	identifies and analyzes job duties and qualifications that define the scope and complexity of work performed. It also 
30	researches labor market pay range data for the most accurate indicator of prevailing wages and salaries for comparable 
31	jobs.
32	
33	Talent Development's key priorities and resources will be aligned with the trends and recommendations highlighted in the 
34	Workforce Equity Strategic Plan (WESP), Jemmott Rollins Report, and Employee Survey. This includes development of a 
35	Leadership Development and Accountability Model, Onboarding and Orientation resources for newly hired managers, and 
36	the implementation of the Core Competency Framework that will support performance development and integrate with the 
37	Performance Planning Review (PPR) process. 
38	
39	Talent Development coordinates countywide training for employees, provides management/supervisory coaching and 
40	training, partners with the Office of Diversity and Equity on implementing the Equity and Empowerment Lens and offers a 
41	variety of diversity awareness and skills building courses. Talent Development develops training options by using data from 
42	employees needs surveys, consulting with senior leadership, aligning with key trends and best practices in training and 
43	organizational development and responding to urgent emerging needs. 
44	
45	Talent Acquisition centralized resources will lead the development of programs and tools that support and respond to the 
46	recommendations of the WESP. This includes developing county-wide shared language for recruitment and selection 
47	processes that build upon the Competency Model and diversity-focused best practices. This also includes leveraging the 
48	Workday system and other resources to support a more structured onboarding process for managers. These resources will 
49	be deeply informed by talent acquisition trends and research.

17	Executive Summary
18	
19	Central Human Resources requests one-time-only resources to fulfill recommendations outlined in the Workforce Equity 
20	Strategies Plan (WESP) and Jemmott Rollins Group (JRG) Recommendations. This proposal represents an intensive 
21	reinvestment in managers and supervisors, building critical leadership skills and equipping them to leverage the authority of 
22	their positions to create a workplace culture of safety, trust, and belonging. This model will serve as a template for 
23	onboarding all new supervisors after FY 20.
24	
25	Program Summary
26	The recommendations emphasize leadership development, a One County approach ensuring all managers and 
27	supervisors have a common framework for leading effectively. These three components will help to achieve that goal: 1. a 
28	conference for all managers and supervisors; 2. a Leadership Development and Accountability Program; and 3. a campaign 
29	to roll out the Competency Model.
30	
31	The conference aims to align countywide expectations with the ideal of workforce equity and inclusion, to inaugurate a One 
32	County approach to building consistent leadership excellence, and to inspire change. The conference is intended to 
33	provide county-specific tools, learning and resources to equip managers to best respond and support the workforce equity 
34	standards outlined in the WESP and JRG recommendations.
35	
36	In FY'18, managers attended an average of less that 4 hours of management training offered by the county. Designing a 
37	leadership development and accountability model was a key recommendation outlined in the JRG recommendation, 
38	reinforced by the COO as a top priority, and again echoed as a critical next step in the county-wide surveys the Office of 
39	Diversity and Equity conducted in January '19. The design of a Leadership Development and Accountability model will focus 
40	on current managers as well as newly hired managers. 
41	
42	The Leadership Development and Accountability Program is for current and newly hired managers, will ensure managers 
43	and supervisors leverage their authority to promote safety, trust, and belonging, and lead with a racial justice focus. It will 
44	build high-performing leaders with an understanding of county processes and policies and the interpersonal skills to 
45	implement them. 
46	
47	The new county Competency Model describes the behaviors and values expected of all employees. The next step will be to 
48	formally roll-out this model in a two-fold approach: a) Develop tools, resources and trainings that help Managers and 
49	workforce understand how to leverage the competency model and align it with other performance and professional 
50	development tools and b) Launch a branding campaign to further promote the value of the Core Competency Model.

19	Central Human Resources requests one-time-only resources to fulfill recommendations outlined in the Workforce Equity 
20	Strategies Plan (WESP) and Jemmott Rollins Group (JRG) Recommendations. This proposal represents expanded capacity 
21	for diversity and equity training, facilitation and team-building, and mediation.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Budget Office estimated that to fulfill recommendations for training outlined in the WESP and JRG Reports would entail 
26	6800 hours of classroom training, an 85% increase  over what was delivered countywide in FY 18. These recommendations 
27	also include classes on disabilities and accommodations.
28	
29	Talent Development anticipates that with the formation of an investigations unit, the number of service requests for 
30	mediation, facilitation, and team-building for units experiencing conflict will increase, especially following an investigation. 
31	Talent Development also anticipates decreased availability of its current team members to meet these new service requests 
32	as they champion the roll-out of Workday Functionalities, with related change management needs. This proposal increases 
33	capacity for mediation, team-building, training and facilitation for teams experiencing conflict and struggle by creating a 
34	limited duration position. This position will also increase Talent Developments ability to provide culturally specific 
35	facilitation's and training's across County Departments. 
36	
37	The increased capacity for mediation and other services is based on language in the AFSCME local 88 contract that states 
38	the county will make an individual trained in mediation available to employees under a variety of circumstances. 
39	Additionally, a focus from the JRG recommendations include a separate investigatory unit and an enhanced complaints 
40	resolution process, which does include mediation, facilitation, team-building, etc.The decision to make this OTO is to allow 
41	time to evaluate overall structure and scope of work within Talent Development.

17	Labor Relations provides leadership to ensure effective labor-management relationships, appropriate work conditions and 
18	legal compliance that balance the rights of employees with the business needs of the County. This program manages 12 
19	labor contracts, representing 85% of the County workforce, and the Personnel Rules (work rules) that apply to all 100%.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	Contract negotiations present one of the most significant opportunities to forge partnerships with labor unions that serve the 
24	needs of both the County and its employees. Labor Relations was successful during previous negotiations to achieve 
25	staggered dates for contract renewals, which provides the County a better opportunity to strategically plan and time 
26	proposals for contract changes. While this approach means contract negotiations have become a year round workload, it 
27	does better support Labor Relations and department management staff to focus and prepare for each labor agreement. 
28	
29	Forums such as Employee Relations Committee and Employee Benefits Advisory Team along with tools such as negotiated 
30	memorandum create the foundation of open communication, clear and accessible decision making and collaborative 
31	problem solving needed to achieve uniform labor/management practices throughout the County.
32	
33	Labor Relations:
34	  Leads collective bargaining activities, including contract negotiations, interim negotiations, labor contract administration 
35	and interpretation.
36	  Guides development of employee relations programs to create and promote a positive organizational culture, and

38	  Ensures consistent application and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, work rules, grievance and discipline 
39	policies.
40	  Provides internal expertise for dispute resolution, grievance handling, and cooperative problem-solving.
41	  Maintains and develops personnel rules and administers the Countys drug and alcohol testing process.
42	  Coordinates countywide layoff activities and the merit council appeals process.
43	  Manages the Unemployment Claims process; and
44	  Ensures compliance with federal, state, local laws, rules, regulations and labor agreements, and communicates, trains 
45	and coaches supervisors, managers and department human resources units on these requirements

22	employees and families by providing a wide variety of activities, education and services to promote health and well-being.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	Internal administration of the Benefit Programs supports the Countys unique business, labor and financial requirements, 
26	while providing sound fiscal management of the offered plans to obtain the best benefit value for employees and the 
27	organization. The highly trained professional staff oversee administration of a complex array of benefit plans ensuring the 
28	County remains compliant with labor contracts, federal, state and local laws and mandates.
29	
30	The Benefits Program consults and coordinates with County employees and departments to ensure timely enrollment in 
31	benefit plans, complete accurate payroll deductions, produce user friendly benefit communication/educational materials, 
32	and act as an effective liaison between employees and benefit providers to facilitate problem resolution. The program works 
33	closely with County labor bargaining units and management to structure benefit components that provide desirable benefit 
34	options within budgetary constraints.
35	
36	Wellness programs can help reduce employee health plan costs and absenteeism, while enhancing employee retention,

24	
25	DART  performs the duties of the County Assessor including property valuation and assessment, property tax rate/levy 
26	calculation, certifying the property tax roll for collection, ownership and records management, and mapping. It is responsible 
27	for maintaining Real Market Value on over 345,000 real and personal property accounts, and capturing and calculating 
28	Measure 50 "exception value" defined as new construction, renovation or remodeling, which increases total Assessed Value 
29	of taxing districts. DART performs the duties of the Tax Collector who certifies the billing, collecting, and distribution of over 
30	$1.8 billion in property taxes; and the County Clerk functions of document recording, marriage licenses and domestic 
31	partnership registrations, and administration of the Board of Property Tax Appeals.

21	Program Summary
22	
23	The Customer Service program responds to approximately 140,000 inquiries annually, including 60,000 walk-in customers 
24	and approximately 28,000 reported in the County Clerk Function Program Offer. Staff process tax payments, sell copies of 
25	records, process passport applications, and provide general information on behalf of the organization. Property owners, 
26	taxpayers, and citizens, in general, have an expectation of local government to provide responsive, accurate, and quality 
27	service. The ability to connect directly with the taxpayer increases the understanding of government and the role of property 
28	taxation.
29	
30	Staff spends several hours each year training with other sections throughout the organization, as well as gaining knowledge 
31	by reading a variety of relevant informational materials. Customer Service staff also assist the Tax Revenue Management 
32	Program by processing approximately 11,000 over-the-counter tax payments totaling approximately $50+ million dollars 
33	annually. Passport photo and County photo ID processes were transferred under the supervision of DART Customer 
34	Service and relocated to the DART offices in 2014. The operational costs are split between DART and Facilities & Property 
35	Management for photo services.  Other recent efficiency and service improvements included point of sale debit/credit cards

17	The County Clerk Functions program consists of recording land related and other legal documents, issuance of Marriage 
18	Licenses and Domestic Partnership Registrations, acceptance of Passport Applications, creation and maintenance of 
19	permanent records, issuance of certified copies, and administration of the Board of Property Tax Appeals (BoPTA). BoPTA 
20	is responsible for hearing petitions from taxpayers who disagree with their property value. The Board makes decisions to 
21	reduce property values or waive personal property late filing fees based on evidence provided by the taxpayer.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Recording is the process of registering legal documents, thus making them a matter of public record. These documents are 
26	primarily related to real property transactions. The recording process requires staff to review every document for statutory 
27	compliance. The processes for Recording, Marriage Licenses, Domestic Partnership Registrations, and Passport 
28	Applications include the collection of statutory fees. With the exception of Passport Applications, the creation and 
29	maintenance of general indexes and the production of microfilm preserved for permanent retention is a statutory 
30	requirement. 
31	
32	For FY 2018, 146,889 documents were recorded, 6,905 Marriage Licenses were processed, 173 Domestic Partnership 
33	Registrations were issued and 12,545 Passport Applications were accepted. Last year 590 BoPTA appeals were processed. 
34	7,974 passport photos were taken. All areas within the County Clerk Functions program provide direct customer service by 
35	responding to telephone, chat and email inquiries and walk-in customers. The Recording staff assist approximately 15,000 
36	customers at the counter annually and respond to an estimated 15,000 inquiries. The Marriage License and Domestic 
37	Partnership staff assist approximately 28,000 customers at the counter annually and respond to a high volume of inquiries 
38	that are reported within the Customer Service total of approximately 140,000 annually. 
39	
40	This program also makes available records for customer use. Electronic recording functionality was installed in 2012 and 
41	additional service providers were added in subsequent years, improving efficiency and customer service. Currently, 
42	approximately 60% of recording transactions are completed electronically. Over the past three years, records were digitized 
43	and a new search engine for PC's used by customers was installed. Future plans, pending County Executive approval, 
44	include providing digitized records over the internet for public use.

17	The County Clerk scaled offer represents a carryover of unspent restricted revenues for the County Clerk that reside within 
18	the General Fund. A portion of fees on recorded documents is dedicated for the County Clerks pursuant to Oregon Revised 
19	Statute 205.320(2), to acquire storage and retrieval systems and maintain and restore records as authorized by the County 
20	Clerk. Carryover funds will be used for services to continue conversion of historical recorded documents and other County 
21	Clerk records to digital format for a Digital Research Room, and to maintain County Clerk records and systems.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The County Clerk Functions Program consists of recording land related and other legal documents, issuance of Marriage 
26	Licenses and Domestic Partnership Registrations, acceptance of Passport Applications, creation and maintenance of 
27	permanent records, issuance of certified copies, and administration of the Board of Property Tax Appeals (BoPTA). BoPTA 
28	is responsible for hearing petitions from taxpayers who disagree with their property values or waive personal property late 
29	filing fees based on evidence provided by the taxpayer.
30	
31	The County Clerk Carryover Program for FY 2020 will continue the digitization of a large portion of the County Clerk 
32	historical records that are currently in microfiche and microfilm format, as well as some hard copy records, in addition to 
33	providing for maintenance of existing county clerk records and systems. In the past, these records have been available to 
34	the public in DART's public research room via microfilm and microfiche. Records from 1965 forward are available 
35	electronically at public access terminals on site, via the County Clerk Recording system. The digitization of historical records 
36	in FY 2020 continues an ongoing records digitization project. By converting records to digital/electronic format, the County is 
37	positioned to no longer rely upon antiquated microfilm and microfiche equipment, and to provide for optimal space 
38	utilization.
39	
40	The Program aligns with DART's strategic business plan to provide public access to County Clerk records through the 
41	consolidated Customer Service Office, providing public records in an accessible electronic format via a new Digital 
42	Research Room implemented during FY 2014. This comprehensive approach provides improved and efficient service 
43	delivery for access to public records.  The scaled Program Offer utilizes unspent restricted revenues dedicated for the 
44	County Clerk that reside within the County General Fund, to continue digitization of County Clerk records, services related 
45	to the new Digital Research Room and maintenance of County Clerk records and systems.

28	Additionally, unrecorded documentation is often used for name changes to the tax roll. This documentation includes 
29	marriage records, court orders, and death certificates. Accurate ownership information is essential to other DART programs 
30	in ensuring that various notices and tax statements are sent to the correct party. This information is also used for the 
31	production of county maps. Property sales are utilized by the Valuation Section in the process of updating property values. 
32	The Ownership Program monitors certain types of accounts for notification to other areas throughout the organization. 
33	Developed databases enable related work units to access shared data, thereby reducing transfer time and the need for 
34	paper records. A new assessment and taxation system scheduled to go live June 2018 is expected to further increase

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	Special Programs Group (SPG), within the Division of Assessment Recording & Taxation (DART), is responsible for 
18	processing applications relating to property tax exemptions or special assessments. Exempt properties are monitored by the 
19	program for continued qualification. Additional tax roll responsibilities include creating new tax accounts, processing 
20	corrections and verifying correct assessed values. Special Programs maintains property information while providing direct 
21	customer service to interested parties.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	SPG ensures that exempt and specially assessed property is valued in accordance with the law, which maximizes property 
26	tax revenues to fund County programs. Property taxes account for approximately 60% of the County's General Fund 
27	revenues. Failure to monitor this process will result in loss of taxable assessed value. Focus is on timely processing 
28	property descriptions, maintaining ownership and creating new accounts and compliance monitoring of existing exemptions, 
29	careful review of new applications, and resolving appeals. Accurate values maximize the level of tax assessment allowed 
30	under Measure 5 and Measure 50 tax limitation.
31	
32	The Special Programs Group (SPG) maintains and processes over 8,500 accounts with special assessments and/or 
33	exemptions. Specially assessed properties like historic while exempt accounts include property owned and/or occupied by 
34	organizations such as charitable, fraternal, and religious.  Leasehold records are monitored to maintain accurate, taxable 
35	values on over 800 accounts where non-exempt tenants lease from exempt government agencies. SPG is responsible for 
36	approximately 4,000 property tax exemptions for the War Veteran & Surviving Spouse program and the Active Duty Military 
37	program. All of these special assessment and exemption programs are mandated by law. In addition, approximately 500 
38	field inspections are performed as part of the program's compliance activities. Staff calculates and redistributes Maximum 
39	Assessed Values in accordance with Measure 50 tax limitation requirements for thousands of new properties created each 
40	year. SPG contributes to the process to arrive at the total taxable assessed value upon which taxes are calculated and 
41	levied for the benefit of all Multnomah County taxing districts. This program ensures that exempt and specially assessed 
42	property is accurately assessed as required by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). Maintaining accurate market values on 
43	all property relates to the bonding capacity and general obligation bond tax rates for taxing districts in the County.

17	The Personal Property Assessment Program, within the Division of Assessment, Recording and Taxation (DART), is 
18	responsible for processing all taxable Business Personal Property returns received. Personal Property represents 4% of the 
19	value upon which taxes are levied for the benefit of all Multnomah County taxing districts.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	This program is responsible for maintaining Real Market Value and Maximum Assessed Value on all taxable business 
24	Personal Property accounts. Oregon Revised Statutes require annual filings from businesses in the county, comprising 
25	more than 34,000 accounts. 40% of those accounts are equipment leasing companies. Values must be fully recalculated 
26	each year to reflect items added or disposed of by businesses and to calculate depreciation influence on remaining assets.
27	
28	Assessment technicians review returns for accuracy/completeness and select/apply appropriate depreciation factors. 
29	Technicians also conduct research and discovery of businesses and property omitted from the assessment roll. Appraisals 
30	are performed to defend values under appeal. This program assesses Personal Property accurately as required by Oregon 
31	Revised Statutes (ORS), maximizing property tax revenues to fund programs. Maintaining accurate Real Market Values on 
32	all property directly affects the maximum bonding capacity and general obligation bond tax rates for all applicable taxing 
33	districts in the County. Property taxes account for approximately 60% of the County's General Fund revenues. Under the 
34	Measure 50 tax limitation measure, there is no assumption of a 3% increase in personal property taxable value; instead, 
35	each business annually reports existing taxable property. Failure to monitor this process will result in loss of taxable 
36	assessed value and tax revenue. Accurate values maximize the level of tax assessment allowed under Measure 5 and

28	industrial appraisers value approximately 47,244 machinery, equipment and personal property assets and 958 bulk 
29	petroleum storage tanks. Performance is measured through the number of permits completed per year, and annual audits of 
30	machinery, equipment and personal property assets and billboard account review. Additional performance efficiency is 
31	achieved by converting industrial valuation methodologies to income models, land tables and other automated calculation 
32	methods.  Appraisers perform appraisals to defend values under appeal. Industrial properties are high-value accounts; loss 
33	on appeal can result in large tax refunds paid by taxing jurisdictions with interest. Focus is on proper classification of taxable 
34	property and resolving value appeals to minimize cost to taxpayers. This program appraises industrial property accurately 
35	and fairly as required by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS), maximizing property tax revenues to fund programs.

18	The Tax Title Program, within the Division of Assessment, Recording and Taxation (DART), is responsible for the 
19	management, maintenance and disposition of the County's tax foreclosed property portfolio. The County's current inventory 
20	portfolio consists of approximately 210 properties. Less than 10% are properties with improvements or structures. 
21	Properties are disposed of at public sales, private sales, government transfers and donations to non-profits.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The County comes into ownership of real property generally once a year through the foreclosure of delinquent property tax 
26	liens. The tax foreclosed properties are deeded into the Tax Title Program portfolio and are managed and disposed of 
27	pursuant to Multnomah County Code, Chapter 7. Shortly after the properties are deeded to the County they may become 
28	available for repurchase by qualified former owners of record. The program consults with other County departments and 
29	community agencies for housing, services and support for occupants of tax foreclosed properties. Maintenance of the 
30	properties is performed through agreement and reimbursement to Department of County Assets, Facilities and Property 
31	Management Division. 
32	
33	The Tax Title Program researches and inspects properties received to determine their highest and best use. The program 
34	will identify property to be sold at public sale in cooperation with the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office, a private sale or to 
35	made available for donation to governments or non-profits.   Effective January 1, 2016, ORS 275.275 was amended to 
36	redirect the distribution of proceeds from sales, net of approved expenses.  All net proceeds will be credited to the General 
37	Fund, Sub-Fund 10030 Tax Title: Affordable Housing, for the following purposes: (i) Funds for housing placement and 
38	retention support services for youth and families with children; (ii) Flexible rental assistance to place youth and families with 
39	children into housing; or (iii) Funds to develop new low income housing that is affordable to youth and families with children 
40	with 30 percent or lower median family income.

17	This program offer requests $90,000 of one-time-only General Fund to facilitate implementation of key recommendations for 
18	improving the mental health care system in Multnomah County. The funds in this program offer will pay for a contractor who 
19	will work with the Evaluation and Research Unit, Health Department, Commissioner Sharon Meieran's office, local subject 
20	matter experts, and community stakeholders to advance this work.  This project began in FY 2019, but deliverables will not 
21	be complete by the end of FY 2019. This offer continues funding appropriation into FY 2020. 
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The mental health care system is complex, and it involves many cross-sector partners. It is important that resources are 
26	aligned so that people who need to access services can navigate seamlessly through the system and get the help they 
27	need in an effective manner.
28	
29	In FY 2018, the Board approved one-time-only funds for a contractor to produce a comprehensive report describing 
30	strengths, gaps, and opportunities for improvement in the mental health care system in Multnomah County.  The contractor 
31	delivered a final report and public briefing in June 2018; this report is available on Commissioner Meieran's website. This 
32	report found that, by many measures, the mental health system in Multnomah County aligns with the principles of a good 
33	and modern system, including offering an array of services, incorporating evidence-based practices and services, and 
34	incorporating peer support. However, the Report also offered recommendations across several domains to address a 
35	significant disconnect between the systems aims and how the system is experienced by many stakeholders.
36	
37	The goal of this program offer is to continue building on and advancing the work of the study by facilitating implementation 
38	of recommendations, including additional detailed analysis of funding and reimbursement for publicly-funded behavioral 
39	health services within Multnomah County. This program offer also supports the involvement of community stakeholders in 
40	implementing the studys recommendations. 
41	
42	The Department of County Management Evaluation and Research Unit will develop and monitor the contract, in partnership 
43	with the Health Department, Commissioner Sharon Meieran's office, and other system partners.

17	The Construction Diversity and Equity Fund program ensures that County construction projects support a diverse local 
18	workforce and provides suppliers a fair opportunity to compete for county contracts regardless of owner ethnicity, gender, 
19	disability or firm size. The program strengthens the Countys commitment to increasing diversity, equity and opportunity in 
20	our workforce and business community.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	Jobs in the fields of construction, professional services and contracting are stable, family wage jobs, but as a result of a 
25	history of discrimination and other barriers, jobs in these fields have not been equally available to all people. Through the  
26	Construction Diversity and Equity Fund (CDEF) program, the County sets aside one percent (1%) of the County 
27	Construction Cost and one percent (1%) of other funds Construction Costs (when permitted by other funding entities) into 
28	the CDEF.  In addition, any liquidated damages assessed by the County for Workforce Training & Hiring (WFTH) non-
29	compliance on projects subject to the WFTH program shall be placed in the CDEF. 
30	
31	The CDEF program supports three initiatives, (1) the development of a diverse, local construction workforce through 
32	support of Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI) certified pre-apprenticeship programs, (2) support and retention services 
33	for new employees to the workforce, and (3) technical assistance, mentoring and training for suppliers (businesses) in the 
34	fields of construction-related professional services or contracting that have been certified by the Oregon Certification Office

17	A DDA must review all available evidence prior to making a charging decision.  Tangible evidence must be reproduced by 
18	the district attorneys office and provided to the defense attorney. When body-worn camera evidence is received by the 
19	DAs Office, the process of reviewing and replicating the evidence will be mandatory, not discretionary. GPD is currently in 
20	the process of purchasing body worn cameras for all GPD patrol officers.  Dramatic increases in prosecutors offices 
21	personnel costs are being experienced nationwide.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Primary among the duties of a deputy district attorney is to review cases submitted by local law enforcement agencies to 
26	determine whether the case should be charged as a crime.  This function is at the heart of the prosecution function.  The 
27	charging decision in every case is guided by a 22-step analysis contained within the MCDA Policy Manual.  As the case 
28	progresses through the system, the video may need to be re-reviewed, redacted, reformatted, and used in trial preparation 
29	and witness preparation.
30	Police departments across the United States are phasing in the use of body warn cameras.  The Gresham Police 
31	Department has instituted an aggressive timeline for equipping their officers with body-worn cameras. Conservative 
32	estimates state that 1.5 hours of video will be created by a police officer on every shift.  Of this 1.5 hours, 10% will contain 
33	video pertinent to a criminal case  video that must be reviewed prior to charging and must be reproduced and given to the 
34	defense after charging.
35	Body-worn camera evidence will be reviewed by a deputy district attorney.  Duplication and distribution of body-worn 
36	camera evidence will be accomplished by non-lawyer staff.  A review of comparably-sized offices from around the country 
37	has shown that, with the adoption of body-warn cameras by law enforcement, prosecutors personnel costs rose between 
38	3%  10%.  For example, the Wayne County District Attorneys Office (Detroit, MI) experienced an 8% increase in personnel 
39	costs after several of their law enforcement partners began using body-worn cameras.
40	Data from body-worn cameras will be voluminous and secure storage will be necessary to comply with witness/victim 
41	privacy concerns as well as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) compliance requirements.
42	Body-worn camera footage will allow prosecutors to view crime scenes and witness/victim/suspect interviews through an 
43	unfiltered lens.  Transparency and system confidence will increase by virtue of additional objective evidence available for 
44	subsequent review.  Charging decisions will improve, leading to better, more just, outcomes.

17	National best practices in criminal prosecution include the use of data research and planning teams to enable data-driven 
18	policy and resource allocation decision making. Similar programs exist within Multnomah County's Department of 
19	Community Justice, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, the Local Public Safety Coordinating Council, the Multnomah 
20	County Circuit Court of the Oregon Judicial Department, as well as within the Portland Police Bureau. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The creation of the Research and Planning Unit will greatly enhance the ability of the District Attorney to make evidence-
25	based decisions and reinforce the countys long standing commitment to data analysis. This unit will produce research that 
26	explores and uncovers prosecutorial effects and trends in Multnomah Countys criminal justice system. This further insight 
27	will facilitate informed policy decision making to strategically address disparities within our county.
28	
29	Furthermore, the trend in public safety in the county and across the nation is for increased cooperation among peers to 
30	answer questions greater than any one entity.  Experience here in the county has shown that when one partner in criminal 
31	justice evaluation comes to the table without the capacity to keep up with others, that weak link causes the whole enterprise 
32	to suffer.  As public safety systems in Multnomah County join to tackle important questions, the District Attorneys office is 
33	determined to be an equal partner with others in this endeavor.  That commitment requires an expansion of the offices 
34	evaluation capacity to invest resources in maintaining and developing new partnerships and programs.
35	
36	Internally, the DAs office is asking more sophisticated questions about its own workings, including examinations of equity 
37	and disparity in prosecution, DDA workload and effectiveness, and case flow efficiency.  At one time it may have been 
38	sufficient to find answers to these questions through the authority of long tenure, management discussion and speculation 
39	by line staff.  These older methods are insufficient in the face of greater reliance in the county and nationwide on 
40	sophisticated data analyses that provide more objective means to drive policy.  The offices single temporary evaluator can 
41	no longer meet our needs; we must be about the business of building a more robust research and planning enterprise.

18	 This program funds the Division I Chief Deputy DA to provide leadership, policy direction, long and short range planning 
19	and daily operational oversight for Division I, which is responsible for protecting some of the most vulnerable children, 
20	adults and families in the County.  This division includes the Multi-Disciplinary Child Abuse Team, Domestic Violence Unit, 
21	Juvenile Court Trial Court, and Support Enforcement Units.  The Chief DDA directs these activities on behalf of children and 
22	families in a variety of leadership and liaison positions inside and outside the office to make our community more livable.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The Chief Deputy District Attorney of Division I is a member of senior level management with specific division level 
27	responsibilities to provide leadership, policy direction, strategic planning, problem solving and daily operational oversight for 
28	the division, which directly affects the lives and safety of children, teens, domestic violence survivors and families in 
29	Multnomah County.  The Chief Deputy has direct and daily oversight responsibility for the Domestic Violence Team, Juvenile 
30	Unit, Multidisciplinary Child Abuse Team, and Child Support Enforcement Unit.  The Chief Deputy also meets weekly to staff 
31	cases to determine appropriate and consistent pretrial resolutions for defendants facing mandatory minimum sentencing on 
32	indicted charges.  The Division I Chief Deputy also prosecutes aggravated murder and murder cases. 
33	
34	The MDT/Child Abuse Unit prosecutes felony crimes involving child victims including homicide, physical abuse, 
35	abandonment and neglect, and sexual assault of children where the perpetrator is considered family and protects 
36	vulnerable children though litigating dependency cases in juvenile court while coordinating child protection efforts and 
37	developing practices and policies to investigate and prosecute abuse and keep children safe and strengthen families.  The 
38	Juvenile Unit prosecutes serious felonies and certain misdemeanors committed by those under18 years of age. That Unit 
39	seeks community protection, reformation of the youth and restitution to victims of crime. The Support Enforcement Division 
40	(SED) establishes, modifies and enforces paternity, child support and medical support orders for the families of Multnomah 
41	County.  The DV Unit prosecutes crimes involving victims and survivors of domestic violence including physical and sexual 
42	assaults, homicides and violations of restraining orders.
43	
44	The Division 1 Chief Deputy performs a critical, family justice liaison role with outside partners, including Department of 
45	Human Services and Child Protective Services, Department of Community Justice, all county police agencies, non-profit 
46	partners, the defense bar, and the court by serving on numerous collaborative working groups.  These include the Family 
47	Violence Coordinating Council, Sexual Assault Response Team (SART), Domestic Violence Court Working Group, 
48	Multidisciplinary Child Abuse Team Executive Committee, Department of Community Justice Working Group, Juvenile

16	Executive Summary
17	The Juvenile Court Trial Units primary function, due to reduced funding, includes some delinquency matters.  This unit, 
18	working with Multnomah Countys Juvenile Services Division, prosecutes serious felonies and certain misdemeanors 
19	committed by those under 18 years of age. This program seeks community protection, reformation of the youth and 
20	restitution to victims of crime.  Refer to program 15101B which partially restores the Unit to two primary functions:  1) 
21	delinquency and 2) limited dependency.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The purposes of the Oregon juvenile justice system are to protect the public and reduce juvenile delinquency and to provide 
26	fair and impartial procedures for the initiation, adjudication and disposition of allegations of delinquent conduct.  This Unit 
27	prosecutes juveniles who have committed all but the most serious (Ballot Measure 11) crimes. This includes cases ranging 
28	from minor misdemeanors to serious felonies. The unit works closely with the Department of Community Justice (DCJ) 
29	Juvenile Division in developing appropriate sanctions aimed at accountability, community protection and reformation of the 
30	child or youth.  Additionally, one of the goals of this program is to reduce the number of youth who are exposed to the adult 
31	criminal system.
32	
33	For over 25 years this program has been involved in the Anne E. Casey Foundations Juvenile Detention Alternatives 
34	Initiative (JDAI). The current interagency agreement with the Juvenile Services Division provides for opportunities for youth 
35	to have their matters handled informally, either through the CHI Early Intervention Program, or through informal handling by 
36	the Juvenile Department.  The current agreement calls for MCDA to provide legal sufficiency screening of all referrals, to 
37	insure that youth are held accountable only for acts that are legally sufficient.  Legal sufficiency screening by non-lawyers 
38	often results in youth being held accountable inappropriately.  The goal of these programs is to provide the principles of 
39	accountable and reformation without pulling a youth further into the Juvenile System.  
40	
41	These DDAs coordinate with the Department of Human Services, DCJ and juvenile court counselors to serve families 
42	impacted by the juvenile system.  Beginning July 1, 2019, the Department of Human Services will redirect state and federal 
43	funds from MCDA to pay their own lawyers at the Department of Justice to represent DHS in all TPR and dependency 
44	matters in Multnomah County. Refer to Program 15101B (Dependency and Delinquency) which partially restores this unit to 
45	two primary functions to serve families in Multnomah County. Lost funding, however, eliminates victims advocates to help 
46	those involved in the court process navigate the complicated and often unfamiliar juvenile system and impacts victim safety 
47	restitution or restorative justice when appropriate. This program will no longer accomplish community protection, youth 
48	reformation and family preservation and skill building to the extent it has in the past.

18	This program allows the Juvenile Court Trial Unit to retain two primary functions: 1) delinquency (prosecuting certain 
19	criminal offenses committed by juveniles), 2) limited dependency (litigating some child protection cases in Juvenile Court).  
20	In dependency, this program seeks child safety while strengthening the protective capacity of families. Refer to 15101 A 
21	which details the delinquency function of the Juvenile Unit.  
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Juvenile Unit will no longer accomplish community protection, youth reformation and family preservation and skill 
26	building to the extent it has in the past.  This Unit will continue to prosecute all but the most serious (Ballot Measure 11) 
27	crimes committed by juveniles. This includes cases ranging from certain misdemeanors to serious felonies. In addition to 
28	delinquency function described in 15101A, this program partially restores this Unit to have two primary functions, 
29	delinquency and limited dependency to serve families in Multnomah County. 
30	
31	Dependency proceedings are noncriminal in Juvenile Court where children are found unsafe and the court needs to 
32	intervene to protect the child.  Dependency is proactive which can result in safer, healthier children who grow up to be 
33	adults who also implement safe parenting practices.  These DDAs seek to protect children, strengthen families and work 
34	with system partners in dependency.  
35	
36	Beginning July 1, 2019, the Department of Human Services will redirect state and federal funds from MCDA to pay their 
37	own lawyers at the Department of Justice to represent DHS in all TPR and dependency matters in Multnomah County. 
38	Because of overall funding loss to the Juvenile Court Unit, DDAs child safety efforts will be reduced and in many cases 
39	DDAs will no longer work with DHS and other agencies and partners to fashion plans which will provide protection for the 
40	child and opportunities for the parents to expand their protective capacity.  Because this Unit has reduced funding, it has 
41	reduced coordination with community and system partners and reduced engagement in the cross-over youth practice 
42	model.

17	Domestic violence is a social, economic and public health concern.  The Domestic Violence Unit prosecutes felonies and 
18	misdemeanors involving victims and survivors of domestic violence including physical and sexual assaults, homicides and 
19	violations of restraining orders.  Additionally, this units mental health DDA handles Aid and Assist issues in a case and 
20	coordinates the efforts of the Multnomah County Mental Health Court and Civil Commitment proceedings.  This team works 
21	closely with our victim advocates to ensure trauma-informed support for survivors and their children.   
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Domestic Violence Trial Unit prosecutes all types of family or intimate partner violence including physical and sexual 
26	assaults (rape, sodomy, for example), strangulation, kidnapping and homicide. The goals of this program are to secure 
27	victim and community safety while seeking defendant accountability.  
28	
29	Additionally, these Deputy District Attorneys play a valuable role in advocating for community-oriented interventions to help 
30	support survivors and their children in breaking the vicious, generational cycle of family violence.  Moreover the Unit works 
31	to ensure that each victim is treated respectfully, compassionately and with dignity.   Our Victim Assistance program assigns 
32	an advocate to each case to provide outreach and assist survivors in obtaining comprehensive wrap around support 
33	services to help alleviate survivors psychological, social, and financial fears. 
34	
35	The unit works in collaboration with state and local law enforcement, the Multnomah County Department of Community 
36	Justice and a variety of local nonprofit domestic violence organizations and shelters. Initiatives include working closely with 
37	the Portland Police Bureau Domestic Violence Reduction Unit (DVRU) and the Domestic Violence Emergency Response 
38	Team (DVERT). The Senior Deputy District Attorney is also an Executive Committee member for the Family Violence 
39	Coordination Council and, the Domestic Violence Fatality Review, the DV court workgroup and is the Co-Chair of the local 
40	Chapter of Justice Jammers, a work group that meets to identify gaps in the justice system affecting domestic violence 
41	victim's safety and offender accountability.
42	
43	The Domestic Violence Unit participates in the Deferred Sentencing program for eligible offenders. This program allows first 
44	time offenders an opportunity to earn a dismissal of the charge upon successful completion of a highly supervised and 
45	closely monitored program of batterer's intervention strategies and counseling. The Domestic Violence unit works with the 
46	county's Adult Protective Services agency to provide a specialized emphasis on the prosecution of elder abuse cases within 
47	Multnomah County. This unit acts as a resource for training of community partners, state and local law enforcement 
48	agencies. The unit dedicates a full time attorney to mental health court and civil commitments for the county.

17	This program serves three primary functions: (1) Prosecute felony crimes involving child victims including homicide, physical 
18	abuse, abandonment and neglect, sexual exploitation and sexual assault (rape sodomy, for example) of children where the 
19	perpetrator is considered family, (2) Protect vulnerable children though litigating dependency cases in juvenile court; and (3) 
20	Coordinate the Multi-Disciplinary Child Abuse Team's child protection efforts and develop practices and policies to 
21	investigate and prosecute abuse while working to help keep children safe and strengthen families.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Multidisciplinary Child Abuse Team (MDT) is part of a larger team comprised of representatives from law enforcement, 
26	public schools, hospitals, courts, health departments, the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS), and the Oregon 
27	Department of Employment Child Care Division. The team provides services to child victims, minimizes the number of 
28	victim interviews, prevents abuse of other potential victims, advances public safety and increases the effectiveness of 
29	prosecution of both criminal and dependency cases. A case in the MDT unit is often time and emotion intensive. 
30	
31	Last year, this program prosecuted some of the most troubling homicides (Abusive head Trauma) and serious felony sexual 
32	and physical assaults against children in the county. These DDAs respond to child death crime scenes all hours of the day.  
33	This team reviews all fatalities which involve a child under the age of 18 years. DDAs also work with DHS and other 
34	agencies to protect children who are abused and neglected.  They work with our Victim Assistance program to ensure all 
35	practices are trauma-informed and mitigate the life-long consequences of child abuse.    
36	
37	Last year, attorneys litigated some of the most high risk/high lethality child protection cases in Juvenile Court. With the 
38	court, DHS and other agencies and community partners the office fashions plans that provide protection for the child and 
39	opportunities for the parents to mitigate the dangers which brought the child to the attention of the court in the first place, 
40	with the goal that the child(ren) and parents to be safe and further parenting skills. 
41	
42	MDT DDAs coordinate discussion and resolution of inter-agency issues, assist in training with agencies involved in child 
43	abuse, participate in policy meetings regarding child abuse and neglect, prepare and update the protocols for the larger 
44	MDT, and advise community partners on child abuse legal issues. The Senior Deputy District Attorney is on call 24/7 to 
45	assist law enforcement, medical personnel and DHS regarding infant deaths and immediate physical and child sexual 
46	assaults.  The Sr. DDA also supervises the juvenile delinquency DDAs.  This program also coordinates the distribution of 
47	state Child Abuse Multidisciplinary intervention (CAMI) funds to a variety of local partners on an annual basis for 
48	projects/services associated with child abuse intervention.

16	Executive Summary
17	The Multnomah County District Attorneys Support Enforcement Division (SED) establishes, modifies and enforces 
18	paternity, child support and medical support orders for the families of Multnomah County as part of The Oregon Child 
19	Support Program (OCSP) by working with both parents to provide the financial and emotional support their children need to 
20	grow and thrive. OCSP delegates the authority of non-public assistance cases to county district attorney offices.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program, operated by the Support Enforcement Division (SED), was enacted in 
25	1975 as a federal-state-local partnership. The federal government reimburses each state 66% of all allowable expenditures 
26	on CSE activities, including staffing costs. The federal governments funding is open-ended in that it pays its percentage of 
27	expenditures by matching the amounts spent by state and local governments with no upper limit or ceiling.
28	
29	Operating in two locations (Downtown and East County), the SED routinely carries an average caseload of approximately 
30	7500 cases and collects approximately $31 million annually. Every dollar collected (less a $25 annual fee after $500 
31	collected) is sent directly to custodial parents for the benefit of the children in our community, providing a critical safety net 
32	for families.
33	
34	Implemented in 2019, a modernized statewide child support computer conversion provides SED with a more automated 
35	system to establish, modify and enforce support orders which result in payments benefiting over 10,000 children in our 
36	community. While seeking accountability from parents ordered to pay support, SED also works to reduce barriers for those 
37	who are unable to meet their obligations by working with the courts to refer parents for job placement, addiction evaluations 
38	and appropriate mental health services.
39	
40	SED works with all 50 states, local tribes, and US territories, to cooperatively provide child support services. In addition, 
41	OCSP and CSE have reciprocity agreements with over 30 foreign nations.

18	This program funds a Chief Deputy District Attorney who provides leadership, policy direction, long and short-range 
19	planning, and daily operational oversight for Division II. This division includes Unit C, Pretrial and the Misdemeanor Trial 
20	Unit. Collectively these units handle a wide range of crimes including aggravated murder, armed robbery, vehicular 
21	homicide, DUII, resisting arrest and criminal trespass. This division also handles a variety of non-trial matters. The Division 
22	II Chief DDA also engages system and community partners in a variety of leadership positions outside the office.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	The Chief Deputy District Attorney of Division II is a member of senior level management with specific division level 
27	responsibilities to provide leadership, policy direction, long and short-range planning and daily operational oversight. The 
28	Chief DDA has direct and daily oversight responsibility of the Unit C, the Pretrial Unit and the Misdemeanor trial unit and 
29	meets daily with attorneys to discuss case strategy and resolution. The Chief Deputy also presides over weekly case 
30	staffing meetings to determine appropriate and consistent pretrial offers for defendants facing mandatory minimum 
31	sentencing on their indicted charges. The Division II Chief Deputy also prosecutes aggravated murder and murder cases.
32	
33	Unit C is a felony trial unit which is responsible for the prosecution homicides, robberies, weapons offenses, gang crimes, 
34	vehicular homicides, vehicular assaults, arson, residential burglaries and felony animal abuse. 
35	
36	The Pretrial Unit is responsible for reviewing and issuing all misdemeanor cases other than those involving domestic 
37	violence. Pretrial attorneys also handle all judicial appeal cases, civil litigation, post-conviction cases, felony arraignments, 
38	habeas proceedings, fugitive and extradition matters, out of state material witness cases and public records requests. The 
39	unit also oversees the administration of the grand jury process.
40	
41	The Misdemeanor Trial Unit prosecutes all misdemeanor crimes except those involving domestic violence. These crimes 
42	include offenses such as driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), resisting arrest, assault, sex abuse, theft, 
43	prostitution, stalking, trespass, strangulation and disorderly conduct. 
44	
45	Lastly, the Division II Chief Deputy performs a critical, criminal justice liaison role with outside partners focused on gang 
46	violence prevention. To that end, the Division II Chief Deputy is the co-chair of the Local Public Safety Coordinating Council 
47	(LPSCC) Youth and Gang Violence Subcommittee and is a member of numerous collaborative working groups such as the

17	This program works collaboratively with the State courts and local law enforcement agencies to prosecute all misdemeanor 
18	crimes except those involving domestic violence. These misdemeanor crimes include offenses such as driving under the 
19	influence of intoxicants (DUII), resisting arrest, assault, sex abuse, theft, prostitution, stalking, trespass, strangulation and 
20	disorderly conduct. Cases handled by the Misdemeanor Trial Unit are either diverted into a specialty court program or they 
21	are set for trial.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Attorneys assigned to the Misdemeanor Trial Unit (MTU) prepare cases for trial and represent the State of Oregon in 
26	misdemeanor jury and bench trials. These attorneys also appear in court on other matters including plea entries, 
27	sentencings, probation violation hearings, and restitution hearings. MTU attorneys work collaboratively with the 
28	Neighborhood and Strategic Prosecution program by prosecuting many of their issued cases. All cases sent to the MTU are 
29	presumed to be trials until otherwise stated. For this reason, all files have to be prepared for actual litigation. This includes: 
30	verifying that all discovery obligations are met, extending a pretrial plea offer to the defendant, subpoenaing all necessary 
31	witnesses for trial, preparing direct and cross examination, assembling all evidence and conferring with victims when 
32	applicable. Misdemeanor Trial attorneys must also review, research and respond to all written motions as part of their trial 
33	preparation.
34	
35	Many misdemeanor cases resolve in one of the specialty courts that are staffed by the MTU.  Most non-violent offenders 
36	qualify for Community Court where they can earn a reduction or dismissal of their charges by giving back to local 
37	neighborhoods through community service while accessing social services such as alcohol treatment, drug treatment and 
38	mental health services. With thousands of cases processed each year, Community Court offers a cost-effective 
39	collaboration between the state courts, prosecution and social service providers. Offenders who decline or are ineligible for 
40	Community Court are prosecuted by the attorneys in the MTU. Because of the large volume of cases and the continued 
41	expansion of East County, prosecutors present cases to courts located in downtown Portland and also in Gresham. 
42	
43	All misdemeanor Possession of Controlled Substance (PCS) cases are now eligible for the Treatment First Program. This 
44	program has drastically reduced the felony-level conviction rate for individuals arrested for drug possession in Multnomah 
45	County. As a result of the Treatment First Program, most of the convictions for drug possession in Multnomah County are 
46	now occurring at a misdemeanor level.

18	Unit A/B, the felony trial unit designated to handle property crimes, human trafficking and drugs, protects victims of 
19	trafficking, assists victims of property crimes and in most cases diverts those individuals struggling with drug addiction into 
20	specialty courts and diversion programs aimed at treatment rather than prison. Crimes prosecuted include compelling and 
21	promoting prostitution, fraud and criminal mistreatment targeting the elderly, auto theft, forgery, identity theft, white collar 
22	crime and delivery of heroin and methamphetamines and fatal overdoses caused by these drugs.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Unit A/B participates in a number of progressive programs aimed at diverting persons away from prison and into treatment.  
27	Most repeat property and drug offenders may avoid presumptive prison sentences by agreeing to intensive supervision and 
28	treatment through the Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP).  Prosecutors in this unit meet with 
29	offenders in judicial settlement conferences to assess their needs.  Working with community justice partners and the courts, 
30	this unit tailors probationary sentence opportunities aimed at reducing recidivism while keeping the community safe.  Input 
31	regarding case resolution is sought from victims in every property crimes case and assigned prosecutors seek restitution on 
32	behalf of victims of these property crimes.  
33	
34	This unit is also responsible for staffing and participating in the Success Through Accountability, Restitution, and Treatment 
35	(START) court program which is a post-sentencing drug court providing supervision and drug treatment for property 
36	offenders.
37	
38	Another program specifically for those with drug addiction, is called Treatment First.  Participants in this program are treated 
39	in lieu of criminal prosecution. The DISP program (DUII Intensive Supervision Program) is also administered in this unit.  
40	Repeat drunk drivers are given the opportunity for court supervised alcohol treatment in lieu of prison as long as they 
41	commit to the terms of the program which includes zero tolerance for alcohol and strict restrictions on driving privileges.
42	
43	In addition to treatment for drug users, this unit plays a key role in the local drug control strategy aimed at dealers by 
44	reducing the supply of drugs through enforcement and prosecution.

18	Felony Trial Unit D prosecutes cases involving violent person crimes committed against non-related victims and survivors 
19	including aggravated murder and other criminal homicides, sexual assaults, kidnapping, weapon assaults and official 
20	misconduct. These cases involve some of the most serious or highest level offenders and some medium level offenders.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	Because of the sensitive, personal and violent nature of the crimes prosecuted in Unit D attorneys have specialized training 
25	to assist survivors and victims cope with the trauma they have experienced and to ensure they have a voice in the criminal 
26	justice process.  A victim advocate is assigned to each case in Unit D supporting the survivors and victims and working 
27	closely with the case prosecutor.  Meetings with survivors and victims typically occur before the case is formally indicted and 
28	continue through case resolution. Survivors and victims have the opportunity to provide input at the various stages of case 
29	prosecution including pre-trial release considerations, settlement negotiations and sentencing hearings.  This program 
30	works in close cooperation with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to prosecute some of the most serious 
31	crimes that occur in Multnomah County. The program is a key partner in the East County Major Crimes Team which targets 
32	and responds to the most serious crimes in the East County communities. The program protects the public and holds 
33	offenders accountable through the prosecution of crimes involving aggravated murder, other types of homicide, aggravated 
34	assault, kidnap, rape and other sex crimes.  In cooperation with a variety of law enforcement and other agencies, this 
35	program investigates and, when appropriate, prosecutes cases involving official misconduct of public officials. The program, 
36	through its inter-agency cooperation, collaboration, and prosecution efforts, is a key part of holding high and medium level 
37	offenders accountable for committing serious person crimes or official misconduct.  When appropriate, offenders are offered 
38	probation in lieu of presumptive prison sentences and receive mental health and addiction treatment under court 
39	supervision as an alternative to incarceration.

28	police and Tri-Met. Each Neighborhood Strategic Prosecution District Attorney is responsible for working with police, other 
29	government agencies, businesses and citizens to improve the quality of life in the areas they serve.  This includes keeping 
30	police officers up to date on criminal law changes, making the criminal justice system user-friendly for responsible area 
31	businesses, marshaling prosecution resources to solve entrenched neighborhood problems, attending community meetings 
32	and providing legal tools for citizens and police to use to improve their quality of life, such as collaborating on partnership 
33	agreements, business trespass agreements, homeless issues, diversion programs, innovative gang interventions, focused 
34	prosecutions and involving citizens to obtain search warrants to close neighborhood drug houses.  
35	
36	Specialized prosecutors are contracted with Lloyd Business District and TriMet to prosecute crimes and solve crime 
37	problems specific to those entities. There is also one additional prosecutor in the North/Northeast area assigned to 
38	coordinate county-wide misdemeanor gang prosecutions and probation with the Portland Police and Multnomah County 
39	Circuit Court in an effort to have these emerging gang members mentored by area pastors and community leaders. In

18	The victim advocate is a champion for the victim during various stages of the criminal justice process. The primary goal of 
19	the Victim Assistance Program and Restitution Recovery Program is to make the criminal justice system more responsive to 
20	individual citizens, particularly to victims of crime. It is the philosophy of the office that every effort be made to provide 
21	victims a meaningful role throughout the process and involvement at every stage of a criminal case, and assure the rights of 
22	crime victims by investigating the economic loss to victims and ensuring that losses are accurately presented in court.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Victim Advocates work directly with crime victims to explain the overall criminal justice system as well as how individual 
27	stages apply to their situation. Victim advocates act as a liaison between diverse stakeholders including law enforcement, 
28	attorneys, government and community agencies, and victims of crime. They translate highly complex and technical 
29	information about the criminal justice process in a trauma informed manner to best help victims. This includes the rights 
30	afforded to them under the Oregon constitution, safety planning, short-term crisis intervention, court accompaniment; 
31	coordinated advocacy and referrals to an array of services and resources and guiding victims through the prosecution 
32	process so that they can make informed decisions. 
33	
34	All named victims with defendants being prosecuted by the District Attorneys Office receive information about their rights as 
35	victims, an opportunity to submit information about their losses for restitution, and notification letters on the case status and 
36	disposition. MCDA provides an average of 30,000 victims rights notifications each year.
37	
38	The program also provides 24-hour on-call response to accompany victims and survivors of sexual assault to the hospital 
39	during law enforcement interviews and forensic medical examinations. We carry out this effort with a team of paid staff and 
40	over 40 volunteers. This immediate crisis intervention service provides critical information and resources to survivors of 
41	sexual assault during the early stages of investigation. This allows survivors to make the most informed choices throughout 
42	this difficult process. The immediate response is followed by ongoing support and advocacy throughout the investigation 
43	and prosecution of the case.
44	
45	In addition to the above services, our program has been involved in establishing several other programs: U visa certification, 
46	Witness Intimidation Support Program, Sexual Assault Response Team, Untested Sexual Assault Kit Project, Multnomah 
47	County Justice Reinvestment Project, Human Trafficking Team and prosecution services at the Gateway Center for 
48	Domestic Violence Services.

21	supervision of the Chief Investigator and are directly employed by the District Attorney.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The Investigations unit is staffed by 1 Chief Investigator and 8.5 FTE experienced investigators. Investigators are utilized in 
26	the juvenile, support enforcement and trial divisions of the District Attorneys Office. Investigators works closely and in 
27	cooperation with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and Deputy District Attorneys to provide investigation 
28	services for felony and misdemeanor cases. The program provides case specific evidence gathering and evaluation, 
29	location of witnesses, witness interviews and transport for testimony, court testimony, video redaction of 911 tapes and 
30	video evidence, background investigations and personal service of subpoenas that require witness court appearance. 
31	Investigations are a crucial and integral part of the prosecution of all criminal investigations.
32	
33	The Investigations unit provides support in criminal prosecutions which directly affects the lives and safety of children, 
34	teens, families, LGBT, houseless and other vulnerable populations that have been victims in Multnomah County. 
35	Investigators perform all of the duties listed above and other critical tasks needed to support Deputy District Attorneys and 
36	help them protect the community and hold defendants accountable.
37	
38	Furthermore, communities of color have historically been underserved in Multnomah county. We have assembled a diverse, 
39	gifted, caring and committed Investigative team, more reflective of the community we serve. Over 50% of our team includes 
40	people of color, and 2 fluent Spanish speakers. 
41	
42	Investigators are sometimes required to provide security for the District Attorney, deputy district attorneys, other court 
43	personnel, or witnesses who have been threatened by hostile subjects.

17	The Time and Attendance Unit saves the County money by providing auditing, error correction and reporting to 
18	management. This ensures that agency staff are correctly paid as well as confirming policies, contract language, and work 
19	rules are being consistently followed. The Unit works with employees and management to resolve any payment 
20	discrepancies. This auditing function is critical to the Sheriffs Office as over 80% of the entire MCSO Budget is paid out 
21	through salaries and benefits.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	The Time & Attendance Unit is responsible for the management of payment and leave information for over 800 Sheriffs 
25	Office employees. The Units tasks are magnified by undertaking the critical responsibility of accurately recording and 
26	reporting the time and attendance of employees working a wide variety of schedules, shifts, work classifications and 
27	changing assignments within a 24/7, 365-day environment. The Unit performs time audits before the payroll cycle is run to 
28	ensure all employees are accurately compensated for their work effort. This refined audit corrects potential discrepancies 
29	before they result in inaccurate compensation made to our employees.   
30	
31	The accurate and reliable management of employee time is an important element to the efficient use of public funds and is 
32	often an area susceptible to error in a 24/7 public safety operations environment. The Time & Attendance Unit is one 
33	component of the Sheriffs Offices system of time management accountability which includes appropriate levels of staffing; 
34	use of overtime; use of planned time off such as vacation, personal holidays, sick leave and comp time.  The Unit works 
35	diligently to ensure each employee's payroll and leave numbers are always accurate. This efficiency translates into cost 
36	savings for the County by ensuring accuracy and accountability and supporting employee morale, in part, by providing 
37	MCSO members with accurate and reliable information related to their pay and leave on a timely basis.  
38	
39	During Fiscal Year 2019 the County has ceased to use SAP and implemented Workday as the new County Enterprise 
40	System (ERP), introducing an entirely new Human Capital Management (HCM) system, including time entry and approval 
41	requirements for the County, including the Sheriff's Office.  Because the new ERP operational processes are still being

21	associated regulations and the fast pace at which information flows.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	The Sheriffs Office desires to proactively promote understanding among all audiences and tell the public safety story. In 
25	order to speak from a centralized and coordinated voice, the Communications Unit was created in FY 2018 utilizing existing 
26	Agency resources. In addition to a Public Information Officer (PIO), a Senior Development Analyst was assigned to the Unit 
27	and a Program Communications Specialist was hired. This Team of three dedicated members, along with back-up PIOs 
28	selected from MCSO's sworn-ranks, received communications training to best perform in this role. Policy 620.00  
29	Communications with the Media, was enacted to set expectations and inform the members of proper communications 
30	protocol.
31	
32	The Communications Unit covers all aspects of Sheriff Office operations  corrections, law enforcement, and business 
33	services - and works with appropriate members throughout the Agency to craft comprehensive and strategic messaging.  
34	The Unit thinks creatively and works diligently to develop supporting media materials (e.g. photography, graphics, etc.), 
35	before threading together monthly campaigns. Standard communication means include press releases, articles, social 
36	media (Twitter, Facebook), website, podcasts and videos. 
37	
38	The Communications Unit is also responsible for facilitating the Agencys public presence. The Unit has organized events 
39	for the community, created presentations for the Board of Commissioner Meetings, and produced statements and op-eds 
40	for the Sheriff about community priorities.  
41	
42	Last, but not least, the Communications Unit is responsible for contributing to a positive and accountable work culture in 
43	MCSO. The Development Analyst creates and maintains a wide variety of development products for staff, with policy 
44	acknowledgement, web-based training, scheduling software, and confrontation management reporting are but a few

18	MCSO is an agency whose sworn members are authorized by law to arrest and confine citizens against their will. Its sworn 
19	members are authorized under justifiable circumstances to take human life. With that enormous responsibility and potential 
20	liability, the public deserves assurance that the agency is conducting its mandated duties lawfully, efficiently, and in the most 
21	cost-effective manner possible. Professional Standards, operating independent of the chain-of-command and reporting 
22	directly to the Sheriff, an elected official in charge of the agency, ensures that accountability.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Professional Standards consists of the Inspections Unit, a Life Safety Specialist, Internal Affairs (IAU), Use of Force (UOF) 
27	Inspector and Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Coordinator. These units provide continuous examination of MCSO's 
28	policies, operations and budget in the spirit of meeting accountability and transparency expectations while holding the 
29	Sheriffs Office to the highest industry standards and best practices.
30	
31	Professional Standards ensures accountability through continual inspections and investigations of MCSO operations and 
32	personnel. The Inspections Unit makes recommendations for policies and procedures based on public safety industry 
33	standards and best practices through independent auditing. The unit inspects and audits all facets of MCSO operations 
34	including, correctional facilities, facilitates and monitors safety committees, conducts accident reviews, and provides Life 
35	Safety auditing and training to meet Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards compliance. The 
36	Internal Affairs Unit conducts independent investigations of allegations of employee misconduct to ensure the integrity of 
37	and confidence in MCSO employees. Each complaint is initially evaluated by a Pre-Investigative Assessment. IAU 
38	investigations are conducted in accordance with established due process requirements to ensure accountability of not only 
39	employees but the IAU process itself. The Use of Force Inspector conducts regular audits of Use of Force Reports, makes 
40	recommendations for use of force policies and procedures based on public safety industry best standards, and regularly

19	The Program presently manages approximately 6,800 alarm customers.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	Within the Law Enforcement Support Unit, the Alarms program issues burglary and robbery alarm permits, both for 
24	residential and business customers.  Currently, approximately 6,800 alarm customers are being managed within Alarms. 
25	Within Alarms, a False Alarm Reduction Program is run which tracks burglary and robbery alarms in unincorporated 
26	Multnomah County and through collaborative contracts with east Multnomah County cities. 
27	
28	Effective Alarm-use management increases the probability that law enforcement responds to valid alarms.  Additionally 
29	reduction of false alarms conserves scarce public safety resources by reducing the time that law enforcement officers have 
30	to respond to reported false alarms.  The program includes penalties for the reporting of false alarms which motivates alarm 
31	customers to properly maintain their equipment and exercise sound alarm-use practices.  False alarm response is an 
32	inefficient use of time and resources and presents potential safety concerns for innocent citizens and law enforcement as a 
33	result of an armed response. The efficient use and management of properly-working alarms provides increased security for 
34	the community, a reduction in criminal offenses, more effective law enforcement, and cost savings for the County.

18	MCSO will support Corrections Health by increasing its Clinic Escort Deputy Staff by one thus creating a swing shift clinic at 
19	MCIJ and MCDC.  This will significantly increase inmate access to mental health clinicians, physicians, nurse practitioners, 
20	and physician assistants.  Moreover, the length of appointments and quality of care will be enhanced by extending hours of 
21	clinician availability. This increase of 1.82 FTE for Corrections Deputy staffing will have significant positive outcomes for 
22	both MCSO and Corrections Health.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Corrections Health currently operates clinics within MCDC and MCIJ. Currently, clinics are operated during the day shift, 
27	Monday through Friday. This schedule often does not allow for the ease of movement of inmates seeking medical or mental 
28	health appointments due to staffing short falls. Other aspects of jail operations which require the presence of an Escort 
29	Deputy such as court appearance movements, off-site for work crew projects, kitchen work crews, attorney visits, social 
30	services visits and other necessary tasks often limits staffing.  These multiple demands on Escorts at times limit the ability 
31	to move inmates for medical/mental health appointments due to the lack of Escort Deputy availability.
32	
33	MCSO has assessed, through collaboration with Corrections Health, the need for increased access to medical/mental 
34	health appointments. As such, the dedication of one additional Clinic Escort Deputy for expanded hours on swing shift at 
35	MCDC and MCIJ will allow medical/mental health appointments to be made much more frequently thus significantly 
36	increasing access for inmates to these critical services. A further expected positive outcome of this improvement is the 
37	shortening of jail stays, lessening of the use of force events, increased therapeutic assessments, fewer injuries to inmates 
38	and staff, potential release from custody, and an increased placement of inmates in the appropriate venues such as LEAD, 
39	Unity Center, Hospital, etc.  
40	
41	The upstaffing of the Clinic Escort Deputy position allows for the safe and secure management of the inmate population 
42	requiring Clinic services and creates a safe and secure working environment for Corrections Health Staff. The expansion of 
43	the presence of the Clinic Escort Deputy will significantly enhance an inmates ability to attend medical/mental health 
44	appointments and will increase access for clinicians to better serve the inmate population.

16	Executive Summary
17	The Sheriffs Office Inmate Work Crew provides opportunities for sentenced offenders to learn general labor and social 
18	responsibility while fostering a work ethic that aids in their reintegration into the community. Sentenced offenders who 
19	successfully complete this program receive a sense of self-worth. This is accomplished while meeting the publics needs at 
20	a reduced cost to the taxpayers by freeing up jail beds in the form of reduced sentences for participating offenders.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	Each crew is typically composed of 5-7 offenders supervised by a Corrections Deputy. Offenders are expected to be ready 
25	to work each morning, take directions, and work as part of a team. This program provides instruction on the proper use and 
26	maintenance of general landscaping tools and what type of personal protective equipment is necessary to safely complete 
27	the job. Offenders who successfully complete this program can be released early if it is part of the court order at time of 
28	sentencing. The early release of these minimum custody offenders gives the Sheriff another tool to effectively manage jail 
29	populations ensuring pretrial inmates who are dangerous offenders are not released prematurely into the community due to 
30	jail system overcrowding.
31	
32	Community service work is generally project-oriented. Most of these services are performed for agencies and non-profits 
33	that serve the homeless and other at-risk groups within the community. Crews have participated in community events such 
34	as Friends of the Library, Sand in the City, March of Dimes March for Babies, Polar Plunge, and Race for the Cure to name 
35	a few. Work Crews help in the set up and removal of tents, chairs and activity areas used during these events. The donated 
36	time and labor of work crews supply an invaluable resource to ensure these events are successful. In addition, work crews 
37	offer an emergency labor force during natural or man-made disasters (i.e., sandbagging, removal of downed trees).
38	
39	The majority of contracts are with Multnomah County, Oregon Department of Transportation, City of Portland and Metro 
40	Regional Government. Other agencies include the cities of Gresham, Troutdale, Fairview and Wood Village. Public 
41	contracted work normally consists of roadside, bridgehead and park maintenance, landscaping and a concentrated effort on 
42	cleaning up illegal dumpsites.

18	The Turn Self In (TSI) program limits the overutilization of jail beds for offenders who the court deems eligible to serve their 
19	sentence on weekend days only. This program allows offenders to maintain their employment and/or other family and life 
20	obligations within the community, while being held accountable for their criminal convictions. The TSI program continues to 
21	support the goal of MCSO to find innovative, fiscally responsible alternatives to incarceration.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	The weekend TSI program, operated at the Courthouse Jail Holding area, provides the courts a sentencing alternative 
26	which holds offenders accountable without requiring the use of traditional jail beds. Eligible offenders must meet criteria 
27	which minimizes the overall cost of services of incarceration, including; 24/7 medical, overnight stays, and staffing ratios 
28	associated with traditional jail beds. 
29	
30	This sentencing option averages 30 to 40 offenders each weekend day. The success of this program is due in large part to 
31	its ability to meet the collective needs of the court, Multnomah County, and the offenders.  The TSI sentencing program 
32	provides opportunities for sentenced offenders to maintain employment, family obligations, and pro-social activities, which 
33	support a successful reentry into the community while ensuring judgments of the courts are fulfilled. 
34	
35	In conjunction with the MCSO Programs Unit, offenders sentenced to the weekend TSI program are afforded the 
36	opportunity to participate in AA and/or NA meetings in an effort to treat the underlying addiction issues that may have 
37	contributed to their criminal behavior, as part of MCSOs commitment to Justice Reinvestment.
38	
39	Without the TSI program, judges would have limited options outside of utilizing a jail bed when a decision has been made 
40	that an offender must serve time in custody. The successful attendance and completion rates of those given sentences to 
41	the TSI program indicate the need for this valuable alternative in the criminal justice system in Multnomah County.

17	Members of the Facility Security Unit (FSU) serve as ambassadors of MCSO, and are often the first point of contact for 
18	persons accessing the Multnomah County Courthouse, Justice Center, and the East County Courthouse. Facility Security 
19	Officers (FSO) deter the introduction of weapons into the courts by screening entrants via x- ray and metal detection 
20	equipment and provide emergency response to alarms, medical issues, and disruptions to the court process. In addition, 
21	FSOs serve as a primary source of information to the public and professional staff entering the court facilities.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Facility Security Officers serve as the first point of contact for public and professional visitors to all county courthouses. 
26	Their comprehensive understanding of the judicial process and familiarity with the courthouses and their functions is critical 
27	to providing accurate information to assist in expediting access to the judicial system. 
28	
29	FSOs provide citizens and employees with a safe and secure environment to conduct their business by screening all 
30	persons entering the court facilities. This mission is accomplished by utilizing electronic security screening and conducting 
31	security patrols of both internal and external areas of the facilities.  
32	
33	Persons entering the courts may be emotionally distraught, under the influence of intoxicants, or involved in situations of 
34	abuse.  FSOs are focused on providing a positive point of contact, aimed at calming the tension that can exist in volatile 
35	court matters.  This is accomplished through effective communication skills and providing information to those less familiar 
36	with the judicial system.
37	
38	The core functions of the FSU are public safety, security, emergency assistance, information, and referrals.  The presence 
39	of uniformed FSOs aids in deterring disturbances and criminal activity in the courts and assists in increasing the efficiency 
40	of court processes, saving public resources. The effectiveness of FSOs is demonstrated in the high number of public 
41	contacts, low ratio of exclusions to the number of persons screened, and the number of prohibited items detected during 
42	security screening.

32	agencies and MCSO units to facilitate business transactions for adults in custody.  
33	
34	Citizens can often be discouraged when attempting to navigate through the complexities of the criminal justice system, and 
35	FSOs provide person-to-person information and assistance when needed.  The FSOs ensure continuity of jail operations by 
36	providing a safe environment for the public to transact their business and by working collaboratively with jail staff to process 
37	transactions for adults in custody.  
38	
39	The FSU provides both public and professional access to a variety of different processes that help those in custody 
40	maintain critical relationships with their family, legal representation, and other aspects of their daily lives while they are

19	The presence of uniformed MCSO employees act as a deterrent to disruptions and criminal activity within the library 
20	facilities, reducing the need for a more costly law enforcement response.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Facility Security Unit (FSU) is an integral part of the popular Multnomah County Public Library system.  Facility Security 
25	Officers (FSO) provide a resource for persons needing public safety assistance or information and referrals to other public 
26	entities.  The FSU provides both external and internal security for the Central Library.  
27	
28	The presence of uniformed FSOs creates a sense of well-being and safety for the citizens who use the libraries and the 
29	County employees who work in the libraries. The libraries often experience problems with persons under the influence of 
30	intoxicants, persons who are being disruptive, a transient population who utilizes the library as a safe haven, and persons 
31	who may pose a danger to the public and employees.  
32	
33	The FSOs are a deterrent to disruptions and criminal activity in the library.  The FSOs maintain security and provide a calm 
34	and secure atmosphere by managing all of these situations in a professional manner, using effective communication 
35	techniques.  The presence of uniformed FSOs enables the library patrons to enjoy the libraries and conduct their business 
36	in a safe and inviting atmosphere.  
37	
38	The effectiveness of this work is demonstrated by the low number of instances in which police response is required,

16	Members of the Facility Security Unit (FSU) serve as ambassadors of Multnomah County Sheriffs Office (MCSO), and are 
17	often the first contact point for the public and for professional persons entering the Juvenile Justice Center (JJC). Core FSU 
18	functions include public safety and assistance, security, and public referral.  This is accomplished through one-on-one 
19	contact with the public, entry security screening, and knowledge of the criminal justice system.  The core functions of the 
20	FSU are public assistance and security, ensuring the JJC is accessible to everyone.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Facility Security Officers (FSO) who work at the Juvenile Justice Center (JJC) are primarily responsible for creating a 
25	safe, accessible environment for the public, staff, and others participating in the juvenile judicial process.  
26	
27	This mission is accomplished through security screening of all entrants into the facility via x-ray and metal detector 
28	screening, the presence of uniformed FSOs, area patrols, and one-on-one contact with the public.  Persons entering the 
29	JJC may be under the influence of intoxicants, facing the loss of their children, or suffering some other life-altering situation, 
30	adding a volatile element to an already complex court process. The FSOs serve as both a security presence and an 
31	informational resource to everyone accessing the JJC, aimed at calming tense situations through effective communication 
32	and accurate information.
33	
34	Disruptions and criminal activity interfere with facility and court operations, which also creates difficulties for families, staff, 
35	and professional persons conducting court business.  This can result in higher costs to the taxpayer if court and facility 
36	operations are disrupted, causing them to be delayed or postponed.  The effectiveness of the FSO's work is demonstrated 
37	in the low ratio of exclusions from the JJC to the number of persons screened for entry.

20	Violence is accessible to everyone.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The FSU provides security and public information for both the public and professionals conducting business at The 
25	Gateway Center facility.  Security is provided by a uniformed presence and facility patrols.  The FSU works closely with all 
26	of the various partners at The Gateway Center to facilitate the needs of the public and staff entering the facility.
27	
28	Persons entering this facility may be under the influence of intoxicants, facing the loss of their children, or dealing with other 
29	life altering situations.  The FSO is often the first contact for citizens and professionals accessing the facility.  The FSO, as a 
30	uniformed presence, is a deterrent to disruptions and criminal activities, often calming volatile situations without the need for 
31	additional law enforcement response.  
32	
33	Disruptions and criminal activity interfere with the facility and domestic violence services, and create difficulties for 
34	professionals and families who need to conduct transactions. The effectiveness of the FSOs is demonstrated by the low 
35	ratio of incidents, when compared with the number of persons served at the Gateway Center.  The work of the FSOs in this

16	The Classification Unit is a specialized unit comprised of skilled Corrections Deputies, whose primary function is to 
17	determine appropriate housing of adults in custody during an initial interview using an objective jail classification instrument. 
18	The Classification Unit staff interview every pretrial arrestee and sentenced offender to determine appropriate housing 
19	based upon criminal charge, institutional behavior, risk, and programmatic needs.  This process assists in ensuring the 
20	safety of adults in custody and the safety of staff while supporting efficient management of MCSO's corrections facilities.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Classification Unit is responsible for maintaining a classification system that provides housing configurations used to 
25	create safe separations for pretrial adults in custody and sentenced offenders of different risk and need levels. Important 
26	factors when determining appropriate housing for an adult in custody include; criminal charge, institutional behavior, risk, 
27	and programmatic needs. The Units primary goal is to operate an objective classification system that provides for 
28	separations between violent and non-violent offenders and to facilitate movement through administrative processes from the 
29	most restrictive housing to the least restrictive housing in a safe and structured manner. This is a critical element to ensure 
30	that the jail meets a reasonable standard of care required by the United States Constitution. 
31	
32	Best practice has shown that utilizing an objective classification process is key. This process creates a structure that allows 
33	in custody adults who require special housing or have special needs to be housed in an environment with those of like 
34	needs. Adults in custody who create the potential for compromising safety and security are housed in more restrictive 
35	environments with enhanced security as appropriate. The objective classification process is also designed to identify 
36	programmatic needs and provide adequate services and programs to assist in custody adults in building positive life-skills 
37	with the ultimate goal of successful re-entry into the community. 
38	
39	Finally, the Classification Unit is also responsible to provide an in custody disciplinary process that is fair and balanced to 
40	maintain proper order in the corrections facilities, as well as to promote human values, individual dignity, and socially 
41	desirable changes in attitude and behavior. Holding adults in custody accountable while under the supervision of the 
42	Multnomah County Sheriffs Office is critical to maintain a safe work environment for both employees and adults in custody.

20	health professionals, ensuring that mental health services for adults in custody are maximized through the synergy of 
21	common approaches.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Utilizing 1.00 FTE Corrections Sergeant and 1.00 FTE Corrections Deputy, MCSO is positioned to focus on the mental 
26	health and substance use concerns of incarcerated adults. This team will screen, identify, assess, record, and direct mental 
27	and physical health needs through an established network and system of professionals best suited to provide this critical 
28	care.  This focus on addressing the immediate needs of adults in custody who require specialized mental health attention 
29	ensures necessary care and attention is provided as soon as possible by those best positioned to conduct corresponding 
30	evaluations, direct further care, or prescribe medications in line with a mental health diagnosis.  
31	
32	Where Health Department Staff are relied upon to provide the assessment, diagnosis, and prescription of medication and 
33	care, the MCSO Behavioral Health Team ensures the individual is properly screened upon entry into the facility and properly 
34	classified for receipt of mental health attention as part of this collaborative protocol.  
35	
36	In addition, this Corrections Sergeant and Deputy support the timely facilitation of the weekly Aid & Assist Docket, ensuring 
37	individuals who may require a higher level of mental health care are safely able to attend the court process. In the event an 
38	alternative to jail is ordered, this team coordinates communication for gathering health records and safe, timely transport 
39	from jail. The combining of mental health services, security, and social behavior programming promotes stabilization and 
40	engagement with health services and encourages individuals to advocate for themselves in a positive manner, as well as 
41	provides access to groups for building coping skills. The ultimate goal is to ensure individuals with Severe and Persistent 
42	Mental Illness (SPMI) and/or Substance Use Disorder are properly managed and cared for.  The Team will contribute to a 
43	safe and livable community by facilitating access to services in the facility and linking to the appropriate levels of care within

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	The Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP) is a collaborative effort to improve the assessment of 
19	criminal offenders in Multnomah County and provide a continuum of community-based services and sanctions. Early 
20	assessment and intervention is provided to reduce recidivism while protecting public safety. Success is only possible 
21	through the partnership of the participating MCJRP members. This program provides a Program Administrator to coordinate 
22	a dedicated 59 bed dorm for Justice Reinvestment programming.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Research has shown that education provided to incarcerated individuals addressing readiness for addictions treatment and 
27	employment can increase an opportunity for success resulting in a potential for reduced recidivism. Bringing a targeted 
28	group of offenders together within one dorm allows an increase in access to professionals and programming.
29	
30	MCJRP eligible individuals will be identified early to allow for pre-conviction services and to continue on a more intensive 
31	track once formally sentenced. As the process develops, MCJRP participants in the dorm will have the opportunity to act as 
32	peers to assist new participants in positive social interactions and role modeling. Already existing in-jail programming will be 
33	restructured and partnerships will be expanded to develop additional services in order to remain fiscally responsible and 
34	maximize resources.  In addition, the increase of multidisciplinary staff within jail housing will offer a positive and productive 
35	milieu to promote offender participation.  By building rapport between MCSO staff, the Department of Community Justice 
36	(DCJ), community service providers, and offenders in custody, the program will encourage healthy relationships and 
37	continuity of care once released.
38	
39	Coordination of intensive in-jail programmatic intervention based on the assessed needs of MCJRP eligible adults in 
40	custody assists in increasing the likelihood of success in the community post release. In-jail MCJRP intervention requires a 
41	partnership between MCSO and the DCJ to create a dedicated housing location within MCSOs Inverness Jail allowing for 
42	saturated in-jail programming and proactive linkage to community providers, therefore offering an increased opportunity for 
43	offender success upon release.

16	The Corrections Services Division Close Street Supervision Unit is an intensive supervision program that provides pretrial 
17	services to arrestees of Measure 11 crimes, domestic violence cases, and a select group of clients with behavioral health 
18	needs. Deputies interview defendants and conduct investigations to present the Court with accurate, timely, and impartial 
19	information, which assists the Judge in making an informed release decision. This program supports both accountability and 
20	re-entry of incarcerated adults into the community while increasing available jail beds.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Close Street Supervision (CSS) Unit provides exceptional service to the community by utilizing methods of supervision 
25	that support accountability while transitioning pretrial defendants out of jail beds. 
26	
27	At the direction of the Court, CSS is designed to provide intensive, individualized supervision and management of multiple 
28	need pretrial arrestees who would otherwise be ineligible for release. This program is aimed to support and enhance 
29	community safety by assessing a broad number of the in-custody population for program suitability, expanding case 
30	management and supervision, and providing timely consequences for program violations.  
31	
32	Most recently, the CSS program has realized a dramatic increase in cases from approximately 215 to 320, with the current 
33	funding level designed for a caseload of 125.  Although, the CSS program is still operating at the expanded caseload, the 
34	strain on the resources is impacting the program's overall effectiveness, system partners, CSS staff, and the individuals 
35	assigned to pretrial supervision.  Additionally, community involvement and accountability is limited to an administrative 
36	process, which will begin to challenge program effectiveness.

38	Compared to other pretrial supervision programs, the programs success rates rank among the highest in the nation. An 
39	audit demonstrated that of the almost 1,200 defendants supervised in 2010, more than 96% were successful; appearing for 
40	all scheduled court dates and committing no new crimes while under supervision. More than 99% of Close Street 
41	supervised arrestees successfully complete the program with no new offenses. Close Street participants also appeared for 
42	all scheduled court dates 98% of the time. The national average for both of these measures is 80%**.

18	The Warehouse offers critical support to MCSO Corrections, Business Services, Law Enforcement, arrestees, pre-trial 
19	defendants, sentenced offenders, other agencies, and the public. Warehouse activities include requisitions and receiving 
20	and distributing equipment and supplies to support MCSO units. Also, the Warehouse provides commissary services that 
21	support the needs of adults in custody. The Warehouse, in cooperation with other county, state and federal entities, serves 
22	as the Receipt, Stage, and Storage (RSS) center in the event of certain countywide public health emergencies.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Within the Auxiliary Services Unit, the MCSO Warehouse facilitates the distribution of goods and services in support of 
27	MCSO operations and activities. 
28	The receipt and distribution of property and supplies through the warehouse supports MCSO activities in eleven facilities, 
29	often on a daily basis.  Receiving, warehousing, and distributing items used by MCSO requires continual attention to ensure 
30	accurate and timely logistics outcomes. The Warehouse supports the needs of persons in custody, through ordering and 
31	delivery of detention facility supplies, as well as encompasses commissary operations. Warehouse staff emphasize the 
32	safety and security of personnel and those in custody as their highest priority. Operational goals are prioritized, with 
33	emphasis on supporting the health, safety, and well-being of persons in custody in conjunction with the support of all MCSO 
34	operations. 
35	
36	Warehouse personnel train routinely as part of RSS operational readiness planning and response. This effort requires a 
37	keen focus on situational readiness and a tested collaborative approach to ensure success during times of crisis. This is a

18	Within the Auxiliary Services Unit, the Property and Laundry component performs mandatory functions required by Oregon 
19	Revised Statues (ORS).  MCSO Property Technicians conduct the inventory of all inmate property and ensure safe, secure 
20	storage of property entrusted to their care. Through the inventory process, they are also able to safely identify and ensure 
21	removal of prohibited items from the detention facilities.  MCSO also provides reliable laundry services for persons in 
22	custody, issuing them clean clothing and linens, which are in good condition and repair.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Consistent with governing statute, the Auxiliary Services Unit (through the Property and Laundry Component) is responsible 
27	for the inventory and secure storage of all inmate property and valuables on a continuous basis.  The meticulous inventory 
28	and careful storage of inmate property allows for accurate accountability and prevents the introduction of prohibited items 
29	from entering detention facilities. Property staff ensure that the personal possessions of adults in custody are stored in a 
30	secure and respectful manner and that all funds associated with each individual are accounted for.  Property responsibilities 
31	include bail checks, property and money, releases, and preparation of all out-of-county transports through MCSO facilities. 
32	
33	Laundry Services ensures that adults in custody are provided with clean, serviceable clothing and linens. Clean laundry and 
34	linen products are provided on a bi-weekly basis. Sewing services are also provided to mend and prolong the life of jail 
35	clothing, as well as alterations to staff uniforms. This in-house service provides cost savings to the County by extending the 
36	life of certain textiles and by not incurring contractor costs for similar services outside of MCSO.
37	
38	Laundry services are also provided to the Juvenile Detention Facility and Transition Projects Warming Centers. Transition 
39	Projects serves the homeless population, and the Laundry Facility provides clean blankets twice weekly during the cold

18	Commissary is a self-sustaining program; it does not utilize funding from the Inmate Welfare Fund (IWF) or the General 
19	Fund. Proceeds from Commissary operations are directed into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides direct services and 
20	products that otherwise may not be funded for the benefit of adults in custody. In addition, Commissary personnel are also 
21	included as part of the RSS (Receipt, Stage, and Storage) operations, as support for certain countywide public health 
22	emergencies. 
23	
24	Program Summary
25	
26	Commissary, which is part of the IWF, successfully provides culturally compatible products to adults in custody at 
27	competitive pricing. Commissary provides a sense of normalcy to individuals while incarcerated. Available items in 
28	commissary include personal hygiene products, stationery, and a variety of food items. 
29	  
30	An internal commissary system provides improved contraband control, while allowing adults in custody to buy approved and 
31	appropriate items. Commissary promotes positive behavior among the in-custody population, with increased access to 
32	purchase a larger variety of commissary items based on their housing location. The Commissary program is an important 
33	asset to MCSO's facilities, as both a behavioral management tool and a revenue stream that assists in providing services to 
34	adults in custody within MCSO detention facilities.  Funds received from Commissary are reinvested to directly benefit 
35	adults in custody.  The detention facilities do not make a profit from commissary sales. Profits from commissary sales are 
36	directed into the IWF, which is then utilized to fund additional support services for detainees including chaplain resources, 
37	library materials, as well as assistance to in-custody adults who are indigent.  These additional services boost morale and 
38	create a better atmosphere for those in custody, as well as detention staff. 
39	
40	As of November 1, 2017, inmate accounts changed to a 70/30 split.  Monetary deposits for adults in custody are split with 
41	70% of the funds going to a trust account for spending while in custody, and 30% being applied to debt or other funds owed. 
42	This change has significantly increased commissary order size and frequency.  Adults in custody, who were commonly 
43	indigent due to funds owed, now have the ability to place commissary orders on a more frequent basis.  
44	
45	Additionally, Commissary personnel train routinely as part of RSS operational readiness planning and response. Staff plan 
46	in a collaborative partnership with the Multnomah County Health Department, Emergency Management and other county, 
47	state, and federal entities to assist in the event of certain countywide public health emergencies.

17	The Civil Unit is the enforcement arm of the civil and probate court system. Notice and enforcement actions originate 
18	through the civil, probate, and family courts and are processed through the delivery and services made by this unit. Civil 
19	enforcement actions are statutorily mandated to the Sheriff.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	The Civil Unit is the ministerial arm of the circuit court. All court actions are initiated through a written notification to parties 
24	of a pending action and these documents are delivered by the Civil Unit. Through the Civil Unit, court orders to seize and 
25	sell property, satisfy landlord/tenant actions, and enforce child custody disputes are enforced in an objective, fair, and 
26	equitable manner in compliance with Oregon statutes and rules on civil procedure. Through probate court, families, police 
27	officers and other interested parties seek involuntary commitment for allegedly mentally ill persons suffering from episodes 
28	so debilitating that they are a danger to themselves or others. The Civil Unit deputy locates, transports, and provides 
29	security for the person and the court. When domestic violence threatens the family unit, deputies in the Civil Unit serve 
30	domestic violence restraining orders to protect family members from violence and aggressive behavior.
31	
32	Civil Unit deputies experience incidents of physical resistance when performing their duties. In particular, evictions may 
33	involve subjects who barricade themselves requiring a substantial dedication of resources and time. Often times, these 
34	incidents require the skill of the Multnomah County Special Weapons and Tactics Team to perform a measured response 
35	tactical entry into the residence to execute the eviction while providing safety for nearby citizens. Persons subject to the 
36	courts orders have threatened harm to uniformed staff, displayed firearms, discharged firearms, and fortified apartments 
37	and homes to prevent the court action. It is routine for persons to hide within dwellings to avoid being contacted by civil 
38	deputies. A balanced public safety system provides citizens the ability and right to address their grievances in a safe, fair, 
39	and equitable manner.

16	The Sheriffs River Patrol Unit partners with the Oregon Marine Board, the Port of Portland, and the U.S. Coast Guard to 
17	provide safe commercial and recreational access and passage to the countys 110 miles of waterways along the Columbia 
18	River, Willamette River, Sandy River and Multnomah Channel. The River Patrol Unit provides law enforcement and search 
19	and rescue services to all river, lake, shoreline and island locations in Multnomah County.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	The River Patrol Unit provides protection and intervention for the numerous county moorages, marinas, and houseboat 
24	communities. The countrys fifth largest port requires unobstructed ingress and egress of commercial ship movement into 
25	the region. Marine deputies respond to all life threatening marine calls for service such as boat collisions, drowning, missing 
26	persons, and environmental hazards. Deputies provide boater safety education and intervention through classroom, boat 
27	inspections and enforcement activities. It is crucial for the local economy that cargo vessels, carrying consumer products, 
28	efficiently transport these goods in a timely and efficient manner. In FY 2015, the Port of Portland moved 8,380,848 short 
29	tons of cargo through its facilities and there were 352 calls to port terminals by ocean-going vessel. Community livability 
30	contributes to a thriving economy and access to work, cultural, and recreational activity is an important element of a thriving 
31	economy. River Patrol participates in regional multi-agency marine security drills to promote efficient coordination of first 
32	responder resources. This unit provides critical infrastructure security protection along Multnomah County waterways. The 
33	Oregon Marine Board contributes approximately one third of the funding needs for the Sheriffs Office River Patrol. The 
34	River Patrol Unit is key to emergency preparedness on/near the regional waterways; they participate in numerous agency 
35	collaborations and are a significant function to a visible public safety system.

20	Trafficking Collaborative, International Human Trafficking Task Force and the Department of Justice Trafficking Intervention 
21	Advisory Committee to both aid in prosecution of Human Trafficking crimes and intervene with victims while in custody.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Human Trafficking is a crime that persists even within County jails. At-risk inmates are identified as a commodity, and, once 
26	out of custody, may be passed to persons involved in crimes such as coercion, prostitution, promoting prostitution, sex 
27	abuse, luring and purchasing of a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. This offer continues funding for a 
28	Corrections Sergeant to develop, collect, analyze, organize, and disseminate intelligence information targeting human 
29	trafficking activities inside the jails. The Corrections Sergeant shares information with the various task force partners on 
30	potential perpetrators, maintains a database for tracking information, and uses a screening instrument to quickly identify 
31	vulnerable individuals including at-risk inmates. 
32	
33	Facilitated by the Corrections Sergeant, trafficking victims in custody are connected with in-jail programs and intervention/ 
34	transition services with contracted non-government core service providers. Working with agencies that are part of the 
35	Multnomah County Sex Trafficking Task Force, trauma-informed care for victim needs are addressed, including shelter 
36	services, mental health and substance use services/treatment, mentorship, case management and confidential advocacy.
37	
38	Individuals suspected or convicted of trafficking are identified where their information that may be used in further 
39	investigations. Trafficking purchasers, too, are being documented to provide additional intelligence on Human Trafficking 
40	crimes.
41	
42	The Corrections Sergeant has been working with volunteer interns; mentoring potential criminal justice majors and having 
43	them assist with intelligence data entry and research. Interns have provided over 9,000 volunteer hours the last three fiscal 
44	years. The Corrections Sergeant also presents at local, regional and national law enforcement NGO and Public Events.

26	criminal activity as directed by the Sheriff. The unit conducts criminal investigations of street level illicit drug activity, up to 
27	and including the prosecution of federal narcotics crimes. Investigations often lead to Drug Trafficking Organizations 
28	(DTO's) that transport and eventually sell dangerous drugs for a profit. SIU investigations take them into areas considered 
29	hazardous to health and public safety. Investigations conducted by the SIU detectives have resulted in indictments and 
30	prosecutions in numerous meth lab cases. SIU coordinates clean-up of drug labs. With the changing needs and priorities of 
31	the communities, SIU has modified its mission over the past several years to accommodate the significant impacts of 
32	Methamphetamine and other dangerous drugs infesting neighborhoods, schools, recreational areas and work places. 
33	Statistics show that about 90% of all crime can be attributed to dangerous drugs in the community. The SIU program is 
34	partially funded through grants, revenues received from forfeitures and federal case funding.
35	
36	SIU has the responsibility to proactively identify, investigate, prepare the required investigative reports, apprehend the

18	This program combines Community Resource Deputies and School Resource Officers (SROs). Community deputies assist 
19	with emergency preparedness and safety education and regularly meet with the community. SROs are the conduit among 
20	schools, law enforcement, and social services. These deputies also provide first-line defense if a violent, active threat is 
21	present.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	MCSO provides 24/7 public safety coverage for the residents living in the unincorporated areas of Multnomah County. On 
26	the eastside, these areas include the Columbia River Gorge and Corbett; the Westside includes Sauvie Island and 
27	Dunthorpe. Deputies are first responders to any emergency requiring an immediate response. Working with schools, 
28	businesses, and neighborhood associations, deputies seek to understand community needs and using problem solving 
29	skills to assess, investigate, and intervene in criminal activities. 
30	
31	The Corbett and Reynolds School Resource Officers work with at-risk children and their families and provide educational 
32	classes addressing various issues including drug use. Deputies provide the first necessary step toward intervention. They 
33	are not only a stabilizing force for youth, but in many cases act as role models toward the juveniles they encounter daily. 
34	SRO activities include: illegal drug enforcement, prevention and education; providing resources for guiding and intervening 
35	with at risk high school students by supporting their teachers and parents; and intervening in the exploitation, molestation 
36	and physical abuse of children and assisting their families. 
37	
38	A visible public safety system is a critical factor to citizens feeling safe at home, school, work, and play. Evidence through 
39	the Bureau of Justice Administration studies shows that community policing is a proven and historical strategy to community 
40	safety.

15	Executive Summary
16	
17	This is program was initially funded with one-time-only dollars for FY 2018. A team of two Deputies (2.00 FTE) provides 
18	consistent positive interaction with the homeless, connect them with needed services and provide resources for community 
19	engagement.  MCSO coordinates with service providers and assist the vulnerable homeless population on a daily basis to 
20	ensure their fundamental needs are addressed. 
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The HOPE Team is comprised of two Deputies who provide consistent outreach to homeless citizens in order to connect 
25	them to services and find a path out of homelessness. The Team works collaboratively with service providers to meet the 
26	shared vision of A Home for Everyone  that no one should be homeless; everyone needs a safe, stable place to call home. 
27	
28	The HOPE Team partners with service providers including A Home for Everyone coordinators, the Portland Police 
29	Neighborhood Response Team and Behavioral Health Unit, Gresham Police Neighborhood Enforcement Teams, and the 
30	Multnomah County Joint Office of Homeless Services. The Team will also work with stakeholders including community 
31	groups and businesses to address public safety concerns and create collaborative response plans.
32	
33	The HOPE Team will conduct field outreach on foot and bicycles in their effort to connect with this vulnerable population. 
34	Because some of the homeless may be experiencing mental health challenges, substance abuse issues, military veterans 
35	lacking support, or families in need of immediate assistance, the Team works to understand individual needs to match with 
36	appropriate services. 
37	
38	Being a first-responder to service calls associated with unlawful camping, the HOPE Team provides a compassionate, 
39	outreach first philosophy prior to enforcing unlawful camping ordinances. Homeless citizens are treated with dignity and 
40	respect in all contacts.  When needed, the Team will coordinate clean-up activities with Sheriffs Office Corrections Work 
41	Crews, ensuring the populations valuables are kept safe and that the environment is restored.

17	This program provides for the continued participation of the Sheriff's Office in the East Metro Gang Enforcement Team 
18	(EMGET). East Multnomah County has experienced a significant increase in crime, much of which can be attributed to an 
19	increase in gang-related activity.
20	
21	Program Summary
22	
23	MCSO participates in the interagency East Metro Gang Enforcement Team (EMGET). No individual law enforcement 
24	agency can adequately respond to this unique threat to life, property, and quality of life that has no jurisdictional bounds. As 
25	a result, East County law enforcement agencies have banded together to seek grants; improve interagency and 
26	interdisciplinary communications; coordinate field efforts, records, and information databases; empower residents and 
27	businesses to present a united front to counter gang activity; work in close cooperation with social services to address the 
28	issues that led persons into gangs and in preventative measures for those at risk for joining gangs; and collectively working 
29	with specifically assigned members of the District Attorneys Office to prosecute the gang involved criminal conduct. All 
30	these collective efforts are to identify gang members; reduce actual and feared gang related criminal activity; empower the 
31	community to unite against gang activities and influence; and provide enhanced and focused law enforcement efforts to 
32	reduce actual and feared gang related criminal activity.
33	
34	In areas east of 162nd Avenue, the EMGET provides focused investigative assets towards gang related violent and other 
35	high impact neighborhood crimes; conducts proactive measures to prevent gang related crimes and activities; provides 
36	expertise to regular field staff and the community in gang issues; and collaborates with other criminal justice partners, social 
37	services, and neighborhoods to identify gang related issues and solve gang related problems. Criminal Justice partners 
38	include but are not limited to the Transit Police Detail, Portland Police Bureau, area School Resource Officers, Gresham 
39	Police Department, Fairview Police Department, Multnomah County Sheriffs Office, Multnomah County Department of 
40	Community Justice, and the US Marshals Service. The deputy on EMGET is part of a close knit collaborative team also 
41	comprised of Police Officers from the cities of Fairview, and Gresham.
42	
43	Presentations are made in high schools, middle schools, and community and business groups in regards to deterring gang 
44	involvement and gang involved activities. The EMGET also works with the Oregon Department of Justice to document 
45	confirmed gang members in a statewide database.

18	Executive Summary
19	
20	Members of the MCSO "Green Hornet Trail Rescue Team" are specially trained endurance athletes, tasked with the 
21	reducing search and rescue response times to missing and endangered persons at or near Columbia River Gorge trail 
22	locations.
23	
24	Program Summary
25	Annually, the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office Search and Rescue Unit (SAR) experiences a high volume call workload 
26	from May through September in the late afternoon and early evening hours. Typically, a tourist hiker that has gone for a day 
27	hike at one of the many trailheads in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area and, due to reduced daylight, has 
28	become disoriented which may result in injury or death. The MCSO "Green Hornet Trail Rescue and wilderness Law 
29	Enforcement Team" mission will be to decrease the Search and Rescue response times to missing and endangered 
30	persons calls at or near Columbia River Gorge trail locations.
31	
32	MCSO currently has members who are physically fit endurance athletes who are experienced with hiking, trail running, map 
33	reading, etc. By providing SAR training and necessary equipment, this program will significantly decrease SAR response 
34	call times and increase the opportunity to locate the lost and possibly injured persons much faster resulting in reduced 
35	overtime expense to MCSO (SAR related overtime averages approximately $100,000 per year). Twelve team members can 
36	provide preventative and proactive law enforcement/education functions during trailhead heavy use days, further reducing 
37	search incidents and impacting high incidents of property crime at these locations.
38	
39	In FY 2015, the Green Hornet Trail Rescue and Wilderness Law Enforcement Services Team utilized budgeted funds to 
40	train and equip members under newly established Oregon State Sheriff's Association search and rescue standards. This 
41	training added new capabilities which allow the team to be more effective in evening and night hours better meeting the 
42	needs of the hikers who find themselves lost and requiring rescue services. In the past, many searches had to wait for the 
43	next day break, this changes the outcome in favor of the lost hikers by the rescue team being less restricted by night 
44	conditions.  Additionally, this program will develop strategies to actively engage in proactive education and enforcement 
45	activities response to search, rescue and public safety issues developed from the Eagle Creek Fire.
46	
47	As hazardous conditions created by the fire continue to improve, it is anticipated that federal lands will incrementally re-
48	open in FY19, providing for an increase in search and rescue incidents.

16	Executive Summary
17	
18	The Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP) - Law Enforcement Detail, is comprised of one MCSO 
19	Deputy and one PPB Officer. The detail was created to support the successful community supervision of (MCJRP) 
20	offenders.
21	
22	Program Summary
23	
24	The Multnomah County Justice Reinvestment Program (MCJRP) is a collaborative effort to improve the assessment of 
25	criminal offenders in Multnomah County and provide a continuum of community-based services and sanctions. This 
26	combination of early assessment and intervention is provided to reduce recidivism while protecting public safety. Success is 
27	only possible through the partnership of the participating MCJRP members.
28	
29	In cooperation with parole and probation officers, enforcement officers serve arrest warrants and detainers, assist with 
30	home visits, address verifications checks, transports to housing/appointments, welfare checks, assist with criminal 
31	investigations, and pro-actively patrol areas in which offenders reside or commit crimes. This program offer funds 1.00 FTE 
32	Enforcement Deputy to work in conjunction with a City of Portland Police Officer in the community supporting the Justice 
33	Reinvestment program.
34	
35	Effective intervention to increase the likelihood of success for MCJRP eligible individuals and protect public safety requires 
36	swift/certain sanctions, home visits, and enforcement of court orders and warrants. This makes individuals accountable to 
37	program and supervision requirements while they are in the community.
38	
39	Originally, the Law Enforcement Detail was comprised of more than 60 Law Enforcement Officers and Sheriffs Deputies 
40	from all partner agencies have volunteered for overtime shifts to participate in the detail. The detail appears to be 
41	successful in providing the identified benefits. However, it is agreed that rotating officers and deputies is not optimal 
42	because it limits consistent contact and practices to most effectively support the partnership with PPOs. The Law 
43	Enforcement Detail is now two full time spots filled by one MCSO Deputy and one PPB Officer. The full time spots have 
44	shown to be the most successful and effective method for creating meaningful relationships with PPOs and MCJRP 
45	offenders.

17	Metro serves Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties, and the 25 cities in the Portland metropolitan area. Metro 
18	protects open space and parks, plans for land use, and transportation, and manages garbage disposal and recycling for 1.3 
19	million residents in three counties and 24 cities in the Portland metro region.  Within this mission, the MCSO Metro Services 
20	Unit consists of two detectives who enforce disposal laws and Metro's rules and regulations for disposal and two corrections 
21	deputies that are in charge of two inmate work crews assigned to cleaning up illegal dump sites.
22	
23	Program Summary
24	
25	Through a contract with Metro, a regional government that serves Multnomah, Clackamas, and Washington counties, the 
26	Sheriff's Office provides two detectives to combat illegal dumping, conduct solid waste investigations and assist Metro staff 
27	address camping impacts on Metro properties. The detectives in this unit have knowledge of applicable laws and 
28	ordinances and work to enforce these laws. This includes (but is not limited to): investigation and surveillance of companies 
29	that haul waste to determine if they are disposing of solid waste properly, investigation of incidents of illegal dumping, 
30	coordination of efforts to curtail problems and educate stakeholders with issues associated with solid waste, surveillance of 
31	chronic dump sites, enforcement of cover load requirements, and the coordination of the legal removal of chronic transient 
32	camps. 
33	
34	Illegal dumping is a crime. Illegal dumping is a major problem that raises significant concerns with regard to safety, property 
35	values, and quality of life in the community. In addition, it is a major economic burden on local government, which is typically 
36	responsible for cleaning up dump sites. If not addressed, illegal dumps often attract more waste, potentially including 
37	hazardous wastes such as asbestos, household chemicals, paints, automotive fluids, and commercial or industrial wastes. 
38	Health risks associated with illegal dumping are significant. 
39	
40	The regional housing crisis is resulting in more people living outside. The detectives coordinate with Metro staff, local police 
41	departments including MCSO Hope Team and social service providers to ensure impacts to Metros 17,000 acres of natural 
42	areas and parks are safely and humanely addressed. The need for this coordination increased significantly over the past 
43	two to three years which reduces the available time the detectives have to conduct investigations and surveillance. The 
44	Deputies skills and knowledge are a valuable asset to Metro as is the MCSO HOPE team.
